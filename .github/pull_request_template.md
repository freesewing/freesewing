You're submitting a pull request to FreeSewing, that's awesome :tada:

Before doing so, please take a moment to read up on what sort of pull requests
are **not accepted** (don't worrry, it's short list):

- A pull requests that includes a **major overhaul or refactor** and was not
  discussed or requested beforehand.
- A pull requests that **changes infrastructure code** (changes to pipelines,
  dependency management, monorepo-wide config and so on) that was not discussed
  or requested beforehand.

I welcome contributions big and small, but these kinds are usually more hassle
than they are worth, so let's just not, ok?

tx,
