## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!

Please don't file an issue to ask a question. 
You'll get faster results by contacting us on Discord.
You can get to our Discord server via https://discord.freesewing.org/. 

Please keep in mind that our community members live all over the world. 
So what's daytime for you might be the middle of the night for others.
Please be patient. Sooner or later, somebody will answer.

## What should I know before I get started?

Most of FreeSewing's source code lives in [our monorepo](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing).

There are some exceptions:

 - [`svgtopdf`](https://github.com/freesewing/svgtopdf): The repository holding the source code for our on-demand tiler backend
 - [`tile`](https://github.com/freesewing/tile): The repository holding the source code for our command-line tiler

### FreeSewing packages

We publish a lot of JavaScript packages on NPM. You can find the full list [in the `packages` folder of our monorepo](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/tree/develop/packages).

## How Can I Contribute?

This file is mostly geared towards code contributors, but there's plenty of other ways you can contribute.
