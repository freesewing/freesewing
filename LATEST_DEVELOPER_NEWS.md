##### Project 2022: New frontends for FreeSewing

Over the summer, Joost has started working on *project 2022*, an effort to
migrate the FreeSewing websites (freesewing.org and freesewing.dev) from 
GatbsyJS to NextJS, and in the process consolidate and streamline our various repositories.

It comes with a new development blog, which you can read at: [2022.freesewing.dev/blog](https://2022.freesewing.dev/blog)

If you'd like to get involved in this effert, head over to [discord.freesewing.org](https://discord.freesewing.org/) and

##### Summertime: Things are a bit slower

Things are [a bit slower during the summertime](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/discussions/1139) but
on the plus side, we're looking into playing DnD together.

Join [discord.freesewing.org](https://discord.freesewing.org/) for more info.

There's also a `project-2022` channel there with info on some future stuff we're working on.
