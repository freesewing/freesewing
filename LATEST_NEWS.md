##### FreeSewing v3 is coming

Over the summer, Joost started working on *project 2022*, an effort to
migrate the FreeSewing websites (freesewing.org and freesewing.dev) from
GatbsyJS to NextJS, and in the process consolidate and streamline our various repositories.

Before long, it became clear that there are going to be too many major changes not to bump
the major version.

Take a look at our new development blog, which you can read at [2022.freesewing.dev/blog](https://2022.freesewing.dev/blog), and the [FreeSewing v3 Roadmap](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/discussions/1278).

If you'd like to get involved in this effort, head over to [discord.freesewing.org](https://discord.freesewing.org/) and join the **v3** channel.
