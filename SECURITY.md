## Supported Versions

Until v3 is GA I will support both v2 and v3.
Once v3 is out of beta, I will drop support for v2 shortly after.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- You can report an issue here: https://next.freesewing.org/support
- Or you can email joost, the FreeSewing maintainer, at joost@joost.at.

I do not have money to spend on a bug bounty program, but if you provide your snail mail (physical) address, I will send you some stickers.
