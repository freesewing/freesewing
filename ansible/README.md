# Using Ansible to manage FreeSewing infrastructure

This folder holds [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks and
configuration to manage FreeSewing's infrastructure.

These playbooks do things like installing updates on our servers, handling
maintenance tasks, and so on.

Because of the nature of these tasks, they typically require the kind of access
to our infrastructure that is only available to the maintainer.

As such, you can probably not use these playbooks, but you are welcome to look
around if you are curious or would like to learn about using Ansible in some
real-world scenario.
