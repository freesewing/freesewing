## About FreeSewing 💀

Where the world of makers and developers collide, that's where you'll find FreeSewing.

If you're a maker, checkout [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/) where you can generate
sewing patterns adapted to your measurements.

If you're a developer, the FreeSewing documentation lives at [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/).
The FreeSewing [core library](https://freesewing.dev/reference/api/) is a *batteries-included* toolbox
for parametric design of sewing patterns. But FreeSewing also provides a range 
of [plugins](https://freesewing.dev/reference/plugins/) that further extend the 
functionality of the platform.

If you have NodeJS installed, you can try it right now by running:

```bash
npx create-freesewing-pattern
```

Getting started guides are available for:
- [Linux](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/getting-started-linux/)
- [MacOS](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/getting-started-mac/)
- [Windows](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/getting-started-windows/)

The [pattern design tutorial](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/pattern-design/) will
show you how to create your first parametric design.
