## About FreeSewing 💀

Where the world of makers and developers collide, that's where you'll find FreeSewing.

If you're a maker, checkout [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/) where you can generate
our sewing patterns adapted to your measurements.

If you're a developer, our documentation is on [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/).
Our [core library](https://freesewing.dev/reference/api/) is a *batteries-included* toolbox
for parametric design of sewing patterns. But we also provide a range 
of [plugins](https://freesewing.dev/reference/plugins/) that further extend the 
functionality of the platform.

If you have NodeJS installed, you can try it right now by running:

```bash
npx create-freesewing-pattern
```

Or, consult our getting started guides 
for [Linux](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/getting-started-linux/),
[MacOS](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/getting-started-mac/), 
or [Windows](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/getting-started-windows/).

We also have a [pattern design tutorial](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/pattern-design/) that
walks you through your first parametric design, 
and [a friendly community](https://freesewing.org/community/where/) with 
people who can help you when you get stuck.
