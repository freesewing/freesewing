## What am I looking at? 🤔

This repository is our *monorepo* holding all our NPM designs, plugins, other NPM packages, and (web)sites.

## We are working on FreeSewing v3 🚀

> We the `main` branch and `next` packages on NPM holds v3 code. But it's alpha for now.

The default branch (`develop`) in this repo is where we work on the upcoming FreeSewing v3.
Check out [the roadmap](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/discussions/1278) to
see what we're working towards. There is still time to submit your ideas/suggestions for 
what you would like to see in our mext major release.

The current production code -- what is running on freesewing.org -- is in the `v2` branch.

## Getting started ⚡ 

As this is a monorepo. You'll need [NodeJS v18](https://nodejs.org), [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) on your system.  
Once you have those, clone (or fork) this repo and run `yarn kickstart`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:freesewing/freesewing.git
cd freesewing
yarn kickstart
```

## About FreeSewing 💀

Where the world of makers and developers collide, that's where you'll find FreeSewing.

If you're a maker, checkout [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/) where you can generate
our sewing patterns adapted to your measurements.

If you're a developer, our documentation is on [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/).
Our [core library](https://freesewing.dev/reference/api/) is a *batteries-included* toolbox
for parametric design of sewing patterns. But we also provide a range 
of [plugins](https://freesewing.dev/reference/plugins/) that further extend the 
functionality of the platform.

If you have NodeJS installed, you can try it right now by running:

```bash
npx create-freesewing-pattern
```

Or, consult our getting started guides 
for [Linux](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/getting-started-linux/),
[MacOS](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/getting-started-mac/), 
or [Windows](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/getting-started-windows/).

We also have a [pattern design tutorial](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/pattern-design/) that
walks you through your first parametric design, 
and [a friendly community](https://freesewing.org/community/where/) with 
people who can help you when you get stuck.
