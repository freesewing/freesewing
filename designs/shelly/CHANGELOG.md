# Change log for: @freesewing/shelly


## 3.0.0 (2023-09-30)

### Changed

 - All FreeSewing packages are now ESM only.
 - All FreeSewing packages now use named exports.
 - Dropped support for NodeJS 14. NodeJS 18 (LTS/hydrogen) or more recent is now required.


This is the **initial release**, and the start of this change log.

> Prior to version 2, FreeSewing was not a JavaScript project.
> As such, that history is out of scope for this change log.
