title: When all else fails, try Email
---

If the [other contact channels](/contact) aren't working out for you
and you need contact a human being, you can send an email to
hello@FreeSewing.org.

<Note compact>

You will almost certainly get a faster response if you reach
out [via Discord](/contact/discord).
