FreeSewing is a community project, ran by volunteers.
If you need a human being to talk to, these are the best ways to get in touch:

## FreeSewing on Discord

The FreeSewing community gathers at [discord.FreeSewing.org
](https://freesewing.discord.org/).

It is the best place to ask questions, get help, or merely hang out and make
new friends.

## FreeSewing on GitHub

We use GitHub to host our code, but also to track our work, collaborate, and
build consensus.

You can find us at [github.com/freesewing/freesewing
](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/). You'll not only find all our
source code and documentation, but also
[issues](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues) and
[discussions](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/discussions). 

While you're at it, don't forget to star our repository, that's always nice.

## Something else?

These are just the two most common ways, but there's more options:
