Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards 
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action 
in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, 
offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or 
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions 
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons 
for moderation decisions when appropriate.
