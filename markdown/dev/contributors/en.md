Thank you for being part of our community, and for wanting to contribute! ❤️  

FreeSewing is an open source project ran by volunteers from different corners of the world.
We would love to have you on board, but before we get to that, let's look at what we expect from you:

<Note>

##### Contributor requirements

 - Please respect [our community standards](https://freesewing.org/docs/various/community-standards/)
 - As a contributor, you must uphold [our Code of Conduct](/contributors/code-of-conduct/)

</Note>

With that out of the way, here's a few more things that are *good to know*:

<Tip>

##### Did you know?

 - Nobody gets paid to work on/for FreeSewing. We are a 100% volunteer organisation.
 - We have patrons who support us financially, but all the money that comes in goes to charity -- 
   See our [revenue pledge](https://freesewing.org/docs/various/pledge/) for details

</Tip>


With the formalities out of the way, please continue

or [Where to get help](/contributors/help/).
