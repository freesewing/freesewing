Our website for makers.

## FreeSewing.dev

Our website for developers.

## Frontend

A user-facing interface. Can refer to one of our websites, or our development environment.

## Gatsby

A static-site generator using React. Both freesewing.org and freesewing.dev are
built with Gatsby.

## i18n

Short of _internationalisation_. within the context of FreeSewing, this mostly
means translation, but can also relate to other intenationalisation concerns such
as the type of units to use, or paper sizes, and so on.

## Issue

An issue is a sort of support ticket. It can be a bug report, a feature request, a question
or problem report.

Issues are hosted on Github. Each repository can have its own issues, but most our
issue are handled on our monorepo: https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues b

## Javascript

The programming language in which FreeSewing is written. It can run in your
browser, as well as outside of it with Node JS.

## Made-to-measure

Made to someone's (body) measurements, rather than based on specific sizes.

## Markdown

A plain text markup format that is easy to read for computers and humans alike.
It's a way to write things in plain text, yet make them look pretty in HTML.

All our content is written in markdown. Github issues, commit messages, and comments
also all support markdown.

## Monorepo

A monorepo is an organisational approach to software development where rather than
having a multitude of repositories, a number of different software pieces are bundled
together in a single repository.

FreeSewing's monorepo holds all our Javascript packages in such a structure.

## Node

Node (or Node JS) is a Javascript runtime that allows to use the language outside the browser.

## Parametric pattern design

A design approach whereby sewing patterns are contructed based on parameters, 
and can adapt automatically when those parameters change.

Those parameters almost always include body measurements, and user preferences.

## Patron

A person who supports FreeSewing financially.

## Plugin

An extension to FreeSewing core that provides an extra feature of functionality.

## Pull request

A pull request is a proposal to commit changes to a repository.

Pull requests can either be made because the person does not have the rights to make 
changes to the repository directly. Or to discuss or validate the changes prior to
accepting them.

## React

A Javascript framework to build user interfaces on the web.

All our frontends are build with React.

## Repository

We develop our software collaboratively, and all code is available in Github in so-called repositories.

One repository bundles a bunch of things that belong together. Think of it as a project.

## Tiler

The FreeSewing tiler is responsible for taking a pattern and splitting it into different
pages so it can be printed.

The tiler is a backend service that is independent from the main FreeSewing backend.

## Translator

Somebody who helps with our i18n efforts by translating from Enlish to other languages.
