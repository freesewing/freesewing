title: Community building
---

The FreeSewing community resides [on Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/). 
Just being there to answer questions and chat with other people is a valuable part of community building.

We also can be found [in plenty of other places](https://freesewing.org/community/where/) where we'd love to have you join us.

Apart from being present in chat rooms and social media, you could also take on some responsibility on one or more platforms.
