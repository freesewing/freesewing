title: Project management
---

There's a lot going on within the FreeSewing project and it's easy to forget about something.

A project manager would be helpful to prioritize tasks, makes sure all tasks have an issue,
organize milestones, and so on.

This is helpful in more than one way:

 - It reduces the cognitive load of the people implementing changes because they don't have to worry about forgetting things
 - It increases transparency by making it clear what sort of things are being worked on
 - It gives us that good feeling of closing the issue when the task is done
