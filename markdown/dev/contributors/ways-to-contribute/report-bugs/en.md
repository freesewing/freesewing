Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 
Create an issue [in our monorepo](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%90%9B+bug&template=bug-report.md&title=Bug+report) if you've found one.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. 
* **Include relevant information** such as your username on the site, or the person you drafted a pattern for.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. it worked fine before but since the latest update it doesn't)
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
