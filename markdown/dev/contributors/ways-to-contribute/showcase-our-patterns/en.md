title: Showcase our patterns
---

Anytime somebody has made one of our patterns, we like to showcase it on [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/showcase/).

Unpublished showcases are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 
Create an issue [in our monorepo](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%91%8D+good+first+issue%2C+%F0%9F%93%B8+showcase%2C+%F0%9F%A4%97+community&template=showcase-template.md&title=Create+showcase+from+this+content) when you've made one of our patterns, or have come across pictures from another maker who did.
