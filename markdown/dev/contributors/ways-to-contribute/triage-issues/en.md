title: Triage issues
---

Triaging issues is a great way to get involved in FreeSewing. You can do tasks such as:

 - Making sure issues are properly labeled
 - Ensuring they have a good title that explains the issue in brief
 - Assigning issues to people to make sure they are tended to
 - Keeping an eye on stale issues, and either updating or closing them
 - Assigning issues to milestones so we can plan our releases

All FreeSewing contributors have triage permissions that allows them to do this.
If you don't have the rights, or bump into any issues, [reach out to us on Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org).
