Welcome to the FreeSewing documentation for developers.

Our core library is a toolbox for parametric sewing pattern design.
Here's some of the most relevant reference documentation:

 - [Core API reference](/reference/api/)
 - [Pattern configuration file](/reference/config/)
 - [Settings](/reference/settings/)

We have a [Pattern design tutorial](/tutorials/pattern-design/) that is a 
good way to familiarize yourself with the FreeSewing platform.

Alternatively, we have bite-sized guides that cover [prerequisites](/guides/prerequisites/), [patterns](/guides/patterns/), [best practices when designing](/guides/best-practices/), and [plugins](/guides/plugins/).
