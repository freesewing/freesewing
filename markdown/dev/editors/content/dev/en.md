The content for our freesewing.dev website is stored in the `dev` folder 
of [our Markdown repository](https://github.com/freesewing/markdown/).

Each page is in its own folder and contains an `en.md` file.
All images and other media used by the page/post will also be contained in the folder.

<Note>

You might still see some files from other langauges (like `es.md`, `fr.md`, `de.md`, or `nl.md`) that
predate the decision to only provide freesewing.dev in English.

You can remove those files.
