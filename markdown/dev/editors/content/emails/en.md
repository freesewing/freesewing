By *emails* we mean the kind of automated emails that are sent out by
the FreeSewing backend. Like when you sign up, or ask for a password reset
and so on.

The content of these emails comes from the `src/templates` folder 
of [our backend repository](https://github.com/freesewing/backend).

However, most of the actual text that the user gets to see is defined in one of
the YAML files of our i18n package (specifically `email.yaml).
See [strings](/editors/content/strings/) for more details.
