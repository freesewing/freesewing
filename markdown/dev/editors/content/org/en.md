The content for our freesewing.org website is stored in the `org` folder 
of [our Markdown repository](https://github.com/freesewing/markdown/).

Within it, you will find the following 4 subfolders:

 - `org/blog`: Holds the freesewing.org blog posts
 - `org/docs`: Holds the freesewing.org documentation (everything under `/docs` on the site)
 - `org/showcase`: Holds the freesewing.org showcase posts
 - `org/ui`: Holds snippets of text used throughout the UI that are too large or volatile to be translated as strings

Each page or post is in its own folder that contains the following five files:

 - `de.md`: The German version
 - `en.md`: The (original) English version
 - `es.md`: The Spanish version
 - `fr.md`: The French version
 - `nl.md`: The Dutch version

All images and other media used by the page/post will also be contained in the folder.

<Note>

##### Edit, don't translate

As an editor, you only ever work with the `en.md` files. The rest is for the translators.

When creating new content, you don't have to create the other files, only `en.md`. 
The rest will be created automatically.
