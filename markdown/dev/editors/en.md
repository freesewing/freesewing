Content is king, and as an *editor* content is your baby.

We have a few different [content sources](/editor/content-sources/) that all have their own
specific use-cases, but in general content is one of:

 - 95% **Markdown**: Used for the vast majority of our content.
 - 4% **YAML**: Used for the internationalisation of our software.
 - 1% **HTML**: Used in specific places that don't requires internationalisation.

You guessed it, if you know how to work with markdown, you are already covering 
95% of all our content. As such, [our Markdown guide](/editors/markdown/) is mandatory
reading for all editors. Even if you already know Markdown, you will want to make
sure you are aware of all the [custom components](/editors/markdown/custom-components/)
we provide.
