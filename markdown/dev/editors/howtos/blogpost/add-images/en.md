title: Add images to the folder
order: 30
---

Add the images you want to use to the folder. Keep the following guidelines in mind:

 - The main blog picture should be a landscape image
 - The best resolution for the main image is 2000x1348 pixels
 - None of the images should be larger than 2000px on their longest side
 - Use lowercase for all filenames

<Note>

##### Please think twice before dropping a 7Mb image.

Git never forgets. So if you drop a couple of 7Mb images into our repo,
they will be there forever, making cloning the repo very slow.

So please resize your images before you commit your changes.
