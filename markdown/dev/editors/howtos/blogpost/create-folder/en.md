title: Create a new folder for the blog post
order: 10
---

Our [markdown repository](https://github.com/freesewing/markdown/) holds all content
for both freesewing.org and freesewing.dev.

The content for blog posts on freesewing.org is in the `org/blog` folder.

You'll find a bunch of directories here for all the existing blog posts. 
Create a new one keeping in mind that this will determine the URL under which the post
is available. So:

 - No spaces
 - No uppercase
 - Stick to `a-z` and `-` to be safe
