Images are like links, just prefix them with an exclamation mark.
The part between square brackets is the image caption or alt-text.

```md
![This is the alt-text & title](image.jpg)
```

![This is the alt text & title](image.jpg)

<Tip>

The convention is to always place your images in the same folder as the 
text where you are including the image. That way, you just need to specify
the image name, and not the path to its location.
