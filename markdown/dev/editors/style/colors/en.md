title: Colors

##### Open Color

We use [open color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) for our color scheme.
Our default white is `gray-0`, our default black is `gray-9` and we use `violet` for links.

In dark mode we use a slightly darkened `gray-0` color because it is a bit light to
use as a basis for dark mode.

##### Muted titles

For small text, like the one you're reading now, our default white on black or
vice versa works well. For large titles, that contrast is a bit too harsh, which 
is why we mute titles by using `gray-7` for light mode and `gray-4` for dark mode.

##### Links

Links come in varying shades of violet between `violet-8` for light
mode and `violet-2` for dark mode.
