We use three types of fonts:

##### Ubuntu

The [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu) font is our default, both
for text and headings on all our websites.
It's a sans-serif font that works well for text and headings alike.

This text is and example of Ubuntu.

##### Roboto Mono

The [Roboto mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) font is what
we use for code samples and inline monospaced content.

It's the fixed-width version of the Roboto family and pairs well with Ubuntu.

This is an `inline example` and below is a code block example:

```js
const font = "Roboto mono"
```

##### Permanent marker

As part of our efforts in the fall of 2020 to put the FreeSewing community
more front and center, we added the [Permanent Marker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker) font
for specific community related things.
It's a display font, in other words, a fancy one.

This font is only used for a few specific things such as hashtags.
Below is an example:

<Hashtag tag='WeAreFreeSewing' />
