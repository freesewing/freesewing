Headings serve two different purposes:

 - They can give a title to a subsection within your content
 - They can structure lengthy content

Those two roles might sound the same, but they somewhat different.

##### Using titles within content

Often, you just want to put a title on a section of your content to
break it up a bit. In cases like these, use heading levels 5 and 6.
Their spacing is optimized for that kind of use.

It also happens to be how we're using headings on this page.

##### Structuring lengthy content with headings

You can use heading levels 2 and 3 (and if you must, 4) to bring 
structure to a lengthy piece of content.
These headings are intended to make a significant break in 
a flowing text, and as such come with copious spacing above
and below them.

In addition, headings of level 2 and 3 will also get an 
anchor link inserted, allowing users to link to that specific
heading in any given page.

However, due to subtle differences between _SSR_ and client-side
rendering, anchor links are notoriously unreliable, which is 
why it is almost always better to break up your content in
smaller pages, rather than 1 big read.

<Note>

##### Only for blog posts

Do not use this for documentation, instead break up your content
in bite-sized pages.

##### Examples

Below is an example of each heading level, along with a paragraph.

<Note>

##### Never use a level-1 heading

Keep in mind that you should never use a level-1 heading in your
content, as that will be the level of the page title. The example
below is the exception that confirms the rule.

# Heading 1

This is what a paragraph looks like. Ubuntu is a sans-serif font, giving it
a somewhat modern look that is associated with reading on screen, rather than
on paper (where serif fonts reign).

## Heading 2

This is what a paragraph looks like. Ubuntu is a sans-serif font, giving it
a somewhat modern look that is associated with reading on screen, rather than
on paper (where serif fonts reign).

### Heading 3
