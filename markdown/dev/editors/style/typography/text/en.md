##### Text

Text is one of the most important things on the website, so we try to make it look good.

That means things like choosing a nice font, making sure the text is properly
sized, preventing lines from getting too long, having a nice vertical cadence, and so on.

##### Paragraphs

This is what a paragraph looks like. 
We use `1.5` for line height in paragraphs because vertical space is abundantly
available, so in general we are rather generous with vertical spacing.

For the same reason, you should use plenty of paragraphs, rather than
writing one long block of text. It makes your content easier to read.
