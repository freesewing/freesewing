When designing patterns, re-use the measurements that are already in use as much as possible.
Nobody wins when every pattern requires its own set of measurements, or names
certain measurements differently.

<Tip>

###### See our measurements page for standard measurement names

The [measurements reference page](/reference/measurements/)
contains all our standard measurement names.
