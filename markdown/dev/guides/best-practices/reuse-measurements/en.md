title: Re-use measurements
order: 10

When designing patterns, re-use the measurements that are already in use as much as possible.
Nobody wins when every pattern requires its own set of measurements, or names
certain measurements differently.

<Tip>

######  See our models packages for standard measurement names

The [@freesewing/models](/reference/packages/models/)
package contains all our standard measurement names.
