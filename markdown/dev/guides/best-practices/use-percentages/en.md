title: Use percentage options where possible
order: 50
---

When designing patterns, you should refrain from using absolute values.

That 6cm ease you add might be fine for all scenarios you tested, 
but then somebody comes around who is twice your size, or who is making clothes for a doll, 
and things will go off the rails.

Don't be tempted to add absolute values to your patterns, as they don't scale. 
Instead, embrace percentages as options.

<Tip>

##### Use the antperson tests

To check how well your pattern scales, you can 
use the *antperson* test by sampling the pattern for 2 models:

 - A model with measurements of avarage person (the person)
 - A model with measurements 1/10th of an average person (the ant)

A well-designed pattern will scale a factor 10 down and hold its shape.
If your pattern makes assumptions about size, this test will show that.

FreeSewing's development environment provides these tests out of the box,
so you can see their results at the click of a button.
