title: Use percentage options where possible
order: 50

When designing patterns, you should refrain from using absolute values.

That 6 cm ease you add might be fine for all scenarios you tested.
But, then somebody comes around who is twice your size or who is making clothes for a doll,
and things will go off the rails.

Don't be tempted to add absolute values to your patterns, as they don't scale.
Instead, embrace percentages as options.
By using values that are percentages of measurements, the values will scale
and continue to work as the measurements scale up or down.

<Tip>

##### Use the doll and giant tests

To check how well your pattern scales, you can
use the _doll_ and _giant_ tests by sampling the pattern for 3 models:

1. A model with measurements of an average person (the person)
2. A model with measurements 1/10th of an average person (the doll)
3. A model with measurements 3 times that of an average person (the giant)

A well-designed pattern will scale a factor 10 down or 3 up and still hold its shape.
If your pattern makes assumptions about size, these tests will show that.

FreeSewing's development environment provides these tests out of the box,
so you can see their results at the click of a button.
