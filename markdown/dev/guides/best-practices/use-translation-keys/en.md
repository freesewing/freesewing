title: Use translation keys, not text
order: 60

Don't insert literal text in your patterns. Instead, insert a key that can then be translated.

For example, if you want to put *Finish with bias tape* on your pattern, don't be 
tempted to do this:

```js
path.seam.attr("data-text", "Finish with bias tape");
```

That (English) string is now hard-coded in your pattern. As freesewing supports 
translation out of the box, it would be a real shame not to make use of it.

Instead, insert a key to identify the string:

```js
path.seam.attr("data-text", "finishWithBiasTape");
```

This way, it can be translated.

You can find and browse the translations and available translation keys [in the freesewing/freesewing project](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/tree/develop/packages/i18n/src/locales).
