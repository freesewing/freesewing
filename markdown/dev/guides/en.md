##### What makes a guide a guide?

Guides tell a story to further your understanding of a specific topic.

Guides and howtos are on a spectrum with howtos being terse *do-this-then-that* recipes, whereas
guides take more time to explain in-depth what is being done and why.

For more details, refer to [How we structure our documentation](/guides/docs).
