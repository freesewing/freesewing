To make a list, just do as you would in plain text:

```md
- a bullet
- list
  - a sublist
  - item
```

-   a bullet
-   list
    -   a sublist
    -   item

If you want an numbered list, just write numbers.
They don't even have to be the correct numbers:

```md

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
2. Item 3
```

1.  Item 1
2.  Item 2
3.  Item 3
