The pattern configuration holds important information about the pattern

</Example>

A pattern's [configuration](/reference/config/) is created by the pattern designer
and details a number of important things about the pattern, like:

- The **measurements** that are required to draft the pattern
- The different **parts** in the pattern and how they depend on each other
- The different **options** that are available to tweak the pattern

The configuration is part of the pattern's code. It is created by the designer and 
it is the same for everybody using the pattern.
In other words, you cannot change the configuration. Instead, the configuration
specifies what kind of settings the pattern accepts.
