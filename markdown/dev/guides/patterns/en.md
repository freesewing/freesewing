title: How patterns work

This short guide will illustrate and explain how patterns work in FreeSewing.
Not to be confused with how sewing pattern work — although there's [great books

interested — it's about what goes on under the hood each time a sewing
pattern is generated by FreeSewing.

This illustration is a good starting point to gain a better 
understanding of the structure of a FreeSewing pattern:

  part="docs_overview"

 - The right area with the **draft** box and the *SVG* and *React* logos

Let's take a closer look at everything that is contained within our central **Pattern** box:

<Note>

The left and right parts are all about how to integrate FreeSewing in your *frontend*.
In other words, how you'll plug it into your website, or online store, or a mobile
application.

That part is outside the scope of this guide.
