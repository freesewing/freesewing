Parts divide your pattern into re-usable components
</Example>

Parts are a container for the points, paths, and snippets of (a part of) your pattern.
They are also re-usable by other patterns, which makes them a powerful tool to build 
a pattern library.

If you design a T-shirt pattern with a `front`, `back`, and `sleeve`, each of those would be a part.
If you then wanted to make a long-sleeved version of your T-shirt pattern, you only need to design 
a new sleeve part. You can re-use the `front` and `back` parts of your short-sleeved T-shirt pattern, as they did not change.

When developing a FreeSewing pattern, you will spend most of your time designing the individual parts.
