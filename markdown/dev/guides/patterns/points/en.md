Developing a pattern with FreeSewing is similar to doing it on paper.
But instead of using a pencil and paper, you'll be writing code.

Before we can draw any line, we need to know where it starts from, and where it ends.
That's why we have **points**. They are the most basic building block of a
FreeSewing pattern, and their role is to store coordinates.

Each point must have: 

 - A **X-coordinate**
 - A **Y-coordinate**

Together, these coordinates determine the location of the point in the 2-dimensional plane we're drawing on.

<Note>

Points are unlikely to confuse you. The only gotcha is [the
coordinate system](/guides/prerequisites/coordinate-system/) which has a Y-axis that is inverted to what you 
may intuitively expect.

<Tip>

Our example image (which, if you hadn't realized was created with FreeSewing) has a lot of 
points in it. The corners of the boxes, the location where the text goes, and so on.
