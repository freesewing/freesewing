Snippets are little embellishments you can use and re-use on your pattern.
They are typically used for things like logos or buttons. 

Each snippet must have:

 - An anchor point that determine where the snippet will be located
 - The name of the snippet to insert

Since our example image does not have any snippets in it, here's another example
of a `button`, `buttonhole`, and `logo` snippet added to a FreeSewing pattern:

<Example 
  part="snippet" 
  caption="An example of the use of snippets"
