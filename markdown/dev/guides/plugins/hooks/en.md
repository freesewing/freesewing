A **hook** is a lifecycle event. The available hooks are:

 -  [preRender](/reference/hooks/prerender/): Called at the start of [`Pattern.render()`](/reference/api/pattern#render)
 -  [postRender](/reference/hooks/postrender/): Called at the end of [`Pattern.render()`](/reference/api/pattern#render)
 -  [insertText](/reference/hooks/inserttext/): Called when inserting text
 -  [preDraft](/reference/hooks/predraft/): Called at the start of [`Pattern.draft()`](/reference/api/pattern#draft)
 -  [postDraft](/reference/hooks/postdraft/): Called at the end of [`Pattern.draft()`](/reference/api/pattern#draft)
 -  [preSample](/reference/hooks/presample/): Called at the start of [`Pattern.sample()`](/reference/api/pattern#sample)
 -  [postSample](/reference/hooks/postsample/): Called at the end of [`Pattern.sample()`](/reference/api/pattern#sample)

You can register a method for a hook. When the hook is triggered, your method will be
called. It will receive two parameters:

 - An object relevant to the hook. See the [hooks API reference](/reference/hooks/) for details.
 - Data passed when the hook was registered (optional)
