##### There's no need to know everything

FreeSewing sits at the intersection of the world of makers and developers.
If your background is in development, you will need no explaining what SVG is, but might not
know much about designing sewing patterns. 
If on the other hand your background is in sewing or pattern design, you might wonder what
the heck Node JS is and why you should care.

Few people straddle both worlds, so as you start using FreeSewing, chances are 
you'll learn a few new things along the way.
