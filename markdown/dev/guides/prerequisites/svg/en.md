Patterns are rendered as **SVG** — short
for [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) —
an XML-based vector image format and an open standard.
While you don’t need to be an SVG expert, a basic understanding of the format 
will greatly help you to understand FreeSewing.

For example, the coordinate system and the way paths
are structured are all related to the SVG drawing system, which is closely related
to other 2D drawing technologies such as PostScript or PDF.
