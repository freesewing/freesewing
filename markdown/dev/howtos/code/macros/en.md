about: Shows how you can use macros within your pattern

Macros are a way to facilitate pattern design by bundling a bunch of individual actions
into a little routine.

Macros are provided by [plugins](/reference/plugins/). Here are some examples:

<Example pattern="rendertest" options={{ colors: false, circles: false, snippets: false, text: false, widthHd: false }}/>

Refer to [macro documentation](/reference/api/macro/) for details on how to use macros,
and the [plugins](/reference/plugins/) documentation for info on how to create your
own macros.
