</Note>


When you have different pattern parts that look similar -- like the front
and back of a garment -- you may find that there's a lot of dimensions 
shared between them.

The example below is from Aaron where dimensions are shared between 
the back and front part.

Aaron has a file called `shared.js` that looks like this:

```js
export function dimensions(macro, points, sa) {
  macro('hd', {
    from: points.cfHem,
    to: points.hem,
    y: points.hem.y + sa * 2.5 + 15
  })
  // more dimensions here
}
```

In both `front.js` and `back.js` we use this code to add these shared dimensions:

```js
import { dimensions } from './shared'

// ...

  if (paperless) {
    dimensions(macro, points, sa)
    // ... specific dimensions 
  }
```

<Note>

Since our shared dimension method is a so-called _named export_ we need to
import it with the syntax you see above.
