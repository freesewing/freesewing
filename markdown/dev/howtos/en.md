##### What makes a howto a howto?

Howtos give your concrete steps to solve a common problem or challenge.

Guides and howtos are on a spectrum with howtos being terse _do-this-then-that_ recipes, whereas
guides take more time to explain in-depth what is being done and why.

For more details, refer to [How we structure our documentation](/guides/docs).
