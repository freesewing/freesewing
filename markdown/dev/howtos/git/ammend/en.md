title: Change your commit message for the most recent commit
---

If you've made a typo or have another reason why you'd like to
change the most recent commit message, you run this command:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

If you run it like this, it will spin up your predefined editor.
To specify the updated commit message on the command line, run:

```bash
git commit --amend -m "This is my improved commit message"
```
