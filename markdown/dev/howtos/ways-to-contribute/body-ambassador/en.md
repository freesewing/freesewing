Maybe youâ€™re unusually short or tall. 
Maybe you have a bit of a pot belly or very large breasts. 
Maybe you have a disability that requires fit adjustments. 

Whatever it is, if you represent a minority fitting issue you could 
represent this minority to make sure their needs are heard and understood.
