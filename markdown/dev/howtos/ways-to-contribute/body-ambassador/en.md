Maybe you’re unusually short or tall.
Maybe you have a bit of a pot belly or very large breasts.
Maybe you have a disability that requires fit adjustments.

Whatever it is, if you represent a minority fitting issue you could
represent this minority to make sure their needs are heard and understood.
