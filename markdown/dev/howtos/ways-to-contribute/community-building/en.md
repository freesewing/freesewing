The FreeSewing community resides [on Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/).
Just being there to answer questions and chat with other people is a valuable part of community building.

We also can be found in plenty of other places where we'd love to have you join us:

* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/freesewing_org)
* [freesewing.social](https://freesewing.social/@freesewing) (our Mastodon instance)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/627769821272714/)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/freesewing)

Apart from being present in chat rooms and social media, you could also take on some responsibility on one or more platforms.
