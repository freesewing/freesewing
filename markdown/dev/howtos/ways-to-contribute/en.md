title: Ways to contribute
---

Thank you for being part of our community, and for wanting to contribute! ❤️  
FreeSewing is an open source project ran by volunteers from different corners of the world.
We would love to have you on board, and this page lists everything you need to know to get started.

## Requirements

The only requirement we ask from our contributors is that they are the kind of people who
value a safe and welcoming environment for all members of the FreeSewing community.

To that extend, we impose the following requirements to ensure everyone feels safe and welcome:

- Any member of our community must respect [our community standards](https://freesewing.org/docs/about/community-standards/)
- As a contributor, you must uphold [our Code of Conduct](/guides/code-of-conduct/)

Go ahead and read those, we'll wait.

## Good to know

With that out of the way, here's a few more things that are _good to know_:

- Nobody gets paid to work on/for FreeSewing. We are a 100% volunteer organisation.
- We have patrons who support us financially, but all the money that comes in goes to charity —
  See our [revenue pledge](https://freesewing.org/docs/about/pledge/) for details
- FreeSewing follows the [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) specification.
  Contributions of any kind are welcome.

## Where to begin

Below is a list of ideas or roles you could take up.
If you're not sure what to do, or if you have questions, [please reach out to

##### Who wants a job in the tech sector?

For many in our community, contributing to FreeSewing marked their
first steps into the world of open source software development.

I (joost) am happy to provide guidance or mentorship to anyone who
wants to learn, especially when doing so enables upwards social mobility.

[Reach out](https://discord.freesewing.org/) and we let's do this.
