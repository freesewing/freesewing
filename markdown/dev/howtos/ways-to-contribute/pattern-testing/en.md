You could make (a muslin for) our patterns prior to release to make sure everything is ok.

<Tip>
  
Join the `#pattern-design` channel on the Discord server and let us know you would like to help. Here you will find people designing new patterns and reviewing existing patterns. Feedback is very welcome!
