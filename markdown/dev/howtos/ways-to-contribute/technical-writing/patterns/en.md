A good way of contributing to FreeSewing  is writting documentation! 

We don't have specific guidelines on how to write documentation. You can write as you feel fit as long as it's relevant and follows [our Code of Conduct](/guides/code-of-conduct/) and [our community standards](https://freesewing.org/docs/various/community-standards/).

Once in a while you might see some documents using personal tone, such as `When pressing a seam, I like to lay it flat and ensure there are no folds ...`. While the impersonal tone is more common for documentation, the personal tone shows that FreeSewing is not a souless entity, but instead we are a community of awesome people! 

Whenever changing existing documents (be it extending, correcting errors, etc) try to preserve the tone. Don't rewrite the documents to solely change the tone.

If you are writing a new document, pick the style you prefer!
