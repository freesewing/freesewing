```js
optionalMeasurements: [
  'highBust'
]
```

An array with the names of optional measurements that can be used to draft this pattern. 

<Note>

###### Why would you want optional measurements?

This is often used in combination with [the bust plugin](/reference/plugins/bust/) to 
allow a pattern to be drafted to the `highBust` measurement rather than the 
`chest` measurement, thereby providing better fit for people with breasts.
