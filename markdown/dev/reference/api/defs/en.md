title: Defs
---

The `Defs` object in FreeSewing's core library represents an SVG document's
[`defs` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/defs).
It is not directly exposed, but it is available as the `defs` attribute
of an [Svg object](/reference/api/svg/defs).

While the methods exposed by this object are typically only used internally,
they are documented here to facilitate development of plugins.
