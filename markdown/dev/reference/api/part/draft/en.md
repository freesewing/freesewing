title: "The part's draft method"
---

Each part **must** have a `draft` property that holds a method that will draft the part.
In other words, this method is where the actual work happens. The method's signature 
is as follows:

```js
function draft(props)
```

The draft method receives a single parameter, an object which you can _destructure_ to 
access the following properties:
