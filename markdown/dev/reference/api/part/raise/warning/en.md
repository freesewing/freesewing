title: raise.warning()
---

```js
raise.warning(data)
```

The `raise.warning()` method adds an event of type `warning` to the pattern.

What happens with this data is entirely up to the frontend developer.
As such, data can by anything you like. A string is common, but you
can also add arrays or objects with data or information you want to
use in your frontend.

<Tip>

All raise methods are available via [the shorthand method](/reference/api/part/shorthand)
