title: Path.intersects()
---

The `Path.intersects()` method returns the Point object(s) where the path
intersects with a path you pass it.

<Warning>

This method can sometimes fail to find intersections in some curves
due to a limitation in an underlying BÃ©zier library.
Please see [Bug #3367](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/3367)
for more information.

</Warning>

## Signature

```
array|false path.intersects(Path path)
```


<Example caption="Example of the Path.intersects() method">
```js
({ Point, points, Path, paths, snippets, Snippet, getId, part }) => {

  points.A = new Point(45, 60)
  points.B = new Point(10, 30)
  points.BCp2 = new Point(40, 20)
  points.C = new Point(90, 30)
  points.CCp1 = new Point(50, -30)
  points.D = new Point(50, 130)
  points.DCp1 = new Point(150, 30)

  points._A = new Point(55, 40)
  points._B = new Point(0, 55)
  points._BCp2 = new Point(40, -20)
  points._C = new Point(90, 40)
  points._CCp1 = new Point(50, -30)
  points._D = new Point(40, 120)
  points._DCp1 = new Point(180, 40)

  paths.demo1 = new Path()
    .move(points.A)
    .line(points.B)
    .curve(points.BCp2, points.CCp1, points.C)
    .curve(points.DCp1, points.DCp1, points.D)
  paths.demo2 = new Path()
    .move(points._A)
    .line(points._B)
    .curve(points._BCp2, points._CCp1, points._C)
    .curve(points._DCp1, points._DCp1, points._D)

  for (let p of paths.demo1.intersects(paths.demo2)) {
    snippets[getId()] = new Snippet('notch', p)
  }

  return part
}
```
</Example>


## Notes

This is an expensive (read: slow) method that you should only use when you don't know
in advance in what segment of your path the intersection will occur.

If you do know, use one of the intersection methods in [Utils](/reference/api/utils).
