```js
array path.split(Point splitPoint)
```

Splits a path in two halves, on a point along that path that you pass it.

<Example 
  part="path_split" 
  caption="Example of the Path.split() method" 
/>

```js
let { Point, points, Path, paths, Snippet, snippets } = part.shorthand();

points.A = new Point(45, 60);
points.B = new Point(10, 30);
points.BCp2 = new Point(40, 20);
points.C = new Point(90, 30);
points.CCp1 = new Point(50, -30);
points.D = new Point(50, 130);
points.DCp1 = new Point(150, 30);

paths.demo = new Path()
  .move(points.D)
  .curve(points.DCp1, points.DCp1, points.C)
  .curve(points.CCp1, points.BCp2, points.B)
  .line(points.A);

points.split = paths.demo.shiftFractionAlong(0.75);
snippets.split = new Snippet("notch", points.split);

let style = "stroke-width: 3; stroke-opacity: 0.5;";
let halves = paths.demo.split(points.split);
for (let i in halves) {
  paths[i] = halves[i]
    .attr("style", style)
    .attr("style", `stroke: hsl(${i * 70}, 100%, 50%)`);
}
```
