The `Pattern` object in FreeSewing's core library holds all data and logic of a pattern. 
It is the parametric blueprint that when instantiated with a user's measurements and
objects will generate a made-to-measure pattern.

## Pattern constructor

```js
function freesewing.Pattern(object settings) 
```

A pattern is instantiated by passing a [settings object](/reference/api/settings/) to the pattern constructor.

This settings objects holds, amongst other things, the measurements and options chosen by the user.
Refer to the [settings documentation](/reference/api/settings/) for an exhaustive list.


## Pattern properties

 - `settings` : The settings as set by the user
 - `options` : the options as set by the user
 - `config` : The pattern configuration
 - `parts` : A plain object to hold your parts
 - `Part` : The [Part](/reference/api/part) constructor
 - `store` : A [Store](/reference/api/store) instance
 - `svg` : An [Svg](/reference/api/svg) instance
 - `is` : A string that will be set to `draft` or `sample` when you respectively draft or sample a pattern. This allows plugins that hook into your pattern to determine what to do in a given scenario.
