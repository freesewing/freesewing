title: defs
---

A string that will be rendered 
as [the defs section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/defs) of 
the SVG document.

The defs attribute is where plugins will add additional snippets.

```svg
<defs>
  /* svg.defs will be inserted */
</defs>
```
<Warning>

###### Add, but don't overwrite
When adding your own defs, it's important not to
overwrite this property, but rather add your own.

In other words, do this:

```js
svg.defs += myDefs;
```
and don't do this:

```js
svg.defs = myDefs;
```

</Warning>
