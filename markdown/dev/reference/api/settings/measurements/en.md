The `measurements` settings should hold and object with the 
measurements to draft the pattern for. 
The pattern configuration lists all required measurements.

```js
import Brian from "@freesewing/brian";

const pattern = new Brian({
  measurements: {
    chestCircumference: 1080
    shoulderSlope: 55
  }
})
```
