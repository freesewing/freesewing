##### Aligning your buttons and buttonholes

We provide three buttonhole snippets with a different alignment:

 - [buttonhole](/reference/snippets/buttonhole/): Anchor point is the middle of the buttonhole
 - [buttonhole-start](/reference/snippets/buttonhole-start/): Anchor point is the start of the buttonhole
 - [buttonhole-end](/reference/snippets/buttonhole-end/): Anchor point is the end of the buttonhole
