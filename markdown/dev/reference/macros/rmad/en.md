title: rmaD
---

The `rmad` macro removes all dimensions (all nodes created by `hd`, `vd`, `ld`, and `pd` macros).

It is provided by [plugin-annotations](/reference/plugins/annotations), which is
part of [core-plugins](/reference/plugins/core) (so it is available by default).

## Signature

```js
macro('rmad')
```
