The `rmLd` macro removes the nodes added by [the ld macro](/reference/macros/ld).
It is the recommended way to remove (the effects of) a `ld` macro.

It is provided by [plugin-annotations](/reference/plugins/annotations), which is
part of [core-plugins](/reference/plugins/core) (so it is available by default).

## Signature

```js
macro('rmLd', id = 'ld')
```
