It is provided by the [title plugin](/reference/plugins/title).

| Property   | Default | Type                | Description | 
| ----------:| :-----: | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `at`       |         | [Point](/reference/api/point) | The point at which to insert the title |
| `nr`       |         | String              | The number of the pattern part |
| `title`    |         | String              | The name of the pattern part. If title is not set or is an empty string, this won't be rendered, and the version will go beneath the nr.|
| `prefix`   |         | String              | A prefix to add to the created points. This allow for more than 1 title per part, as long as you give them a different prefix.|
| `append`   | `false` | Boolean             | Set this to `true` to append the `nr` to any text already set in Point `at`'s attributes, rather than overwrite it |
| `rotation` | 0       | Number | An optional rotation in degrees |
| `scale`    | 1       | Number | An optional scaling factor |
