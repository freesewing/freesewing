title: Render
---

The `Render` component is componet that renders a FreeSewing pattern.
It's an alternative to rendering patterns as SVG, allowing for more
interactive use of our patterns in your frontend.

<Warning>

This component used to be named `Draft` but was renamed to `Render` to better
capture what the component does.

The name `Draft` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

###### (*) Use `pattern.getRenderProps()` to get these props

The `width`, `height`, `settings`, and `parts` props are provided by the 
[getRenderProps()](/reference/api/pattern/#getrenderprops) method of 
the [Pattern](/reference/api/pattern/) object. 

They are typically uses as in the example below:

```js
<Render {...pattern.getRenderProps()} />
```
