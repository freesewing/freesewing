The **@freesewing/plugin-bust** plugin helps you adapt menswear patterns for breasts.
If you are designing a womenswear pattern, you won't need this plugin. But if you're adapting
a menswear pattern for breasts, or merely want to accomodate both people with and without
breasts, this plugin can help you accomplish that.

<Note>

##### Understanding the use-case for this plugin

Almost all menswear patterns use the chest circumference to draft the garment.

As a person with breasts, using your (full) chest circumference will give you bad fit.
Instead, it's better to use your high bust measurement as chest circumference, and then create extra room for the breasts.

This is the same technique that's used in a full-bust adjustment to fit a womenswear pattern for a person with above-average sized breasts.

This plugin helps you by:

 - Storing the chest circumference in `measurements.bust`
 - Changing `measurments.chestCircumference` to the value of `measurements.highBust`

</Note>

## Use when extending breastless patterns into a with-breasts version

One way this plugin is used is to extend a menswear pattern into a womenswear pattern.
In this case, the plugin will always be loaded since the pattern assumes breasts will be present.

This way you can extend a menswear pattern and have it drafted with the high bust measurement
as chest measurment, after which you can create room for the breasts.

You can see this in practice in our [Carlita][1] pattern, 
which extends the menswear [Carlton][2] pattern.

<Tip>

To learn more about extending a pattern, see [Design inheritance](/howtos/code/inheritance/)

## Use when creating gender-neutral patterns

To create a truly gender-neutral pattern — one that will adapt to breasts only if they are
present — you can use this plugin, but you'll also need a few other things:

- You'll need to mark the breast measurements as [optional measurements](/reference/api/config/optionalmeasurements)
- You'll need to [conditionally load this plugin](/guides/plugins/conditionally-loading-build-time-plugins)

You can see an example of this in [our Teagan design][3].

**TODO**: Write a tutorial on gender-neutral desing

## Installation

```bash
npm install @freesewing/plugin-bust
```

## Usage

Like all [build-time plugins](/guides/plugins/types-of-plugins#build-time-plugins), you
load them by passing them to the [freesewing.Design](/reference/api/design) super-constructor:

```js
import freesewing from "@freesewing/core";
import bust from "@freesewing/plugin-bust";
import config from "../config";

const Pattern = new freesewing.Design(config, bust);
```
