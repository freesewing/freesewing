Published as [@freesewing/plugin-cutlist][1], this plugin adds additional methods to the [store](/reference/api/store/extend) which allow you to configure cutting instructions for your parts.

<Tip> For an in-depth look at how to add cutting instructions to your part, see our [cutlist how-to](/howtos/design/cutlist) </Tip>

## Installation

```sh
npm install @freesewing/plugin-cutonfold
```

## Usage

Either [add it as a part plugin](/reference/api/part/config/plugins) in your
design, or [add it to a pattern instance with
Pattern.use()](/reference/api/pattern/use).

To import the plugin for use:
```js
import { cutlistPlugin } from '@freesewing/plugin-cutlist'
// or
import { pluginCutlist } from '@freesewing/plugin-cutlist'
```

## Methods

The cutlist plugin adds the following methods to the part draft method parameter

### store.cutlist.addCut

The `store.cutlist.addCut()` method will add a set of cutting instructions for the part

#### Signature
```js
store.cutlist.addCut(Object so)
````

Pass an object to the `store.cutlist.addCut` method with any of the following keys; any you don't provide will be filled with the defaults:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| :-- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| cut | Number\|false | 2 | the number of pieces to cut from the specified material. Pass `false` to clear all cutting instructions for the material |
| material | String | 'fabric' | the translation key of the material to cut from |
| identical | Boolean | false | should even numbers of pieces be cut in the same direction? false for mirrored |
| bias | Boolean | false | should the pieces in these cutting instructions be cut on the bias |
| ignoreOnFold | Boolean | false | should these cutting instructions ignore any cutOnFold information set by the part |

<Note>
	<details>
		<summary> You can use any `string` you want for your material, but here are some standard ones we have translation for </summary>
		<div>

| Key   | Translation  |
|:--|:--|
| fabric | Main Fabric |
| lining | Lining |
| canvas | Canvas |
| lmhCanavas | Light to Medium Hair Canvas |
| heavyCanvas | Heavyweight Hair Canvas |
| interfacing | Interfacing |
| plastic | Plastic |
| ribbing | Ribbing |

</div>
</details>
</Note>

#### Example

```js
import {pluginCutlist} from '@freesewing/plugin-cutlist'

const part = {
	name: 'example.front',
	plugins: [pluginCutlist],
	draft: ({part, store}) => {
		// add instructions to cut two from main fabric
		store.cutlist.addCut()
		// add instructions to cut four on the biad from lining
		store.cutlist.addCut({cut: 4, material: 'lining', bias: true, })
		return part
	}
}
```

You can also add multiple sets of cutting instructions for the same material
```js
import {pluginCutlist} from '@freesewing/plugin-cutlist'

const part = {
	name: 'example.front',
	plugins: [pluginCutlist],
	draft: ({part, store}) => {
		// add instructions to 1 from lining
		store.cutlist.addCut({cut: 1, material: 'lining'})
		// add instructions to cut 1 on the bias from lining
		store.cutlist.addCut({cut: 1, material: 'lining', bias: true, })
		return part
	}
}
```

### store.cutlist.removeCut

The `store.cutlist.removeCut()` method will remove cutting instructions from the part

#### Signature

```js
store.cutlist.removeCut(String material)
```

#### Example
```js
import {pluginCutlist} from '@freesewing/plugin-cutlist'

const part = {
	name: 'example.front',
	plugins: [pluginCutlist],
	draft: ({part, store}) => {
		// remove all cutting instructions for all materials
		store.cutlist.removeCut()

		// remove cutting instructions for just one material
		store.cutlist.removeCut('fabric')
		return part
	}
}
```
### store.cutlist.setGrain

The `store.cutlist.setGrain()` method will record the angle of the grainline annotation. This method is called internally by [`plugin-grainline`](/reference/plugins/grainline) to store information for cutting layout tools. You shouldn't have to call it, but it's there if you need it.

#### Signature

```js
store.cutlist.setGrain(Number grainAngle)
```

#### Example
```js
import {pluginCutlist} from '@freesewing/plugin-cutlist'

const part = {
	name: 'example.front',
	plugins: [pluginCutlist],
	draft: ({part, store}) => {
		// set the grainline angle
		store.cutlist.setGrain(0)
		return part
	}
}
```

### store.cutlist.setCutOnFold
The `store.cutlist.setCutOnFold()` method will record the points that make up the cut on fold line. This method is called internally by [`plugin-cutonfold`](/reference/plugins/cutonfold) to store information for cutting layout tools. You shouldn't have to call it, but it's there if you need it.

#### Signature

```js
store.cutlist.setCutOnFold(Point p1, Point p2)
```

#### Example
```js
import {pluginCutlist} from '@freesewing/plugin-cutlist'

const part = {
	name: 'example.front',
	plugins: [pluginCutlist],
	draft: ({part, points, Point, store}) => {
		// set the cut on fold line
		points.p1 = new Point(0, 0)
		points.p2 = new Point(0, 10)
		store.cutlist.setCutOnFold(points.p1, points.p2)
		return part
	}
}
```
