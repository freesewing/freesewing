import RepoPage from "../../../../../src/components/repo-page";

<RepoPage repo="svgtopdf" />

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) app using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) that turns SVGs into (tiled) PDFs.

We've decided to implement this as a stand-alone app rather than integrate it into [our backend](/reference/repos/backend/) because while our backend is highly specific to our own website, this is a feature that others might want to re-use.
