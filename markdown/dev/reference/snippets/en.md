title: Snippets
---

A Snippet is a reusable bit of markup that draws graphic elements on patterns.
Snippets are provided by [plugins](/reference/plugins) and are implemented as
[`defs` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/defs)
in the rendered SVG document.

## Signature

To place a Snippet at a given point:
```js
const snippet = new Snippet(String 'snippet name', Point anchor)
```
