title: cutlist.removeCutOnFold()
---
The `cutlist.removeCutOnFold()` store method will remove stored
cut on fold line information.

This method is called internally by [the `rmCutonfold` macro](/reference/macros/rmcutonfold) to remove stored information for cutting layout tools.
In other words, you typically have no reason to call this method manually.

## Signature

```js
undefined store.cutlist.removeCutOnFold()
