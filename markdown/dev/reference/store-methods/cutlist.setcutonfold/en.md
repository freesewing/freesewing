title: cutlist.setCutOnFold()
---
The `cutlist.setCutOnFold()` method will take two points to determin the cut on fold line.

This method is called internally by [the `cutonfold` macro](/reference/macros/cutonfold) to store information for cutting layout tools.
In other words, you typically have no reason to call this method manually.

#### Signature

```js
undefined cutlist.setCutOnFold(Point p1, Point p2)
```
