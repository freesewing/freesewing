title: removeMacroNodes()
---

Removes nodes generated by macro `id`.
By nodes, we mean paths, points, and so on that have been created by the macro.

When a macro properly uses a combination of `generateMacroIds()` and
`storeMacroIds()`, this method will fully handle its removal.

## Signature

```mjs
Object store.removeMacroNodes(
  String id,
  macro = store.activeMacro,
  part = store.activePart,
)
```

The method takes a (macro) id and removes all nodes created by this macro,
It uses the active macro and part from the store, Or you can pass in `macro` and `part` to not use the active macro or part.

## Example

```mjs
undefined store.removeMacroNodes('macroId')
```
