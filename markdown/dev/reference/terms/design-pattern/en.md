title: Design/Pattern
---

The terms **pattern** and **design** somewhat overlap and their exact meaning
depends on the context.

A **design** is a software package that implements a given design on top of our core library.
[Simon](https://freesewing.org/designs/simon/) is a design, [Teagan](https://freesewing.org/designs/teagan/) is a design, and so is [Sandy](https://freesewing.org/designs/sandy/).

A **pattern** is an instance of a design. A design that's made-to-measure for a user.
