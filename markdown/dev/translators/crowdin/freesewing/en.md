This Crowdin project holds all the *strings* that are used to make the FreeSewing software multilingual.

Crowdin makes translations of such strings very easy.   
If you provide the translation, Crowdin will make sure your changes make it back
into our repository, where they will be picked up and merged by one of the development people.

Here's what you need to know to get started:
