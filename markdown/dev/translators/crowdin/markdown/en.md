This Crowdin project holds all our *markdown content*.

Crowdin makes translations of content very easy by breaking it apart into sentences and paragraphs.   
This may seem weird at first, but it actually has a number of benefits:

 - You never have to tackle an enourmous page of documentation. Whenever you have a few
 minutes to spare, you can just jump in, and translate a few sentences. This makes it much
 simpler to collaborate with others.
 - When (part) of the original (English) content is changed, Crowdin will detect that and let you know exactly what sentences need to be updated.
 - It's easier to keep track of how much has been done/remains to be done
 - Content is more consistent across languages

Once you provide the translation, Crowdin will make sure your changes make it back
into our repository, where they will be picked up and merged by one of the development people.

Here's what you need to know to get started:
