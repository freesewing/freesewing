title: Languages

English is our origin language. Which means that everything is written in English
and then translated from English into other languages.

We currently support the following five languages:

  - **en** : English (our origin language)
  - **de** : German
  - **es** : Spanish
  - **fr** : French
  - **nl** : Dutch

If you'd like to start working on a new language, that's great, but a bit
beyond the scope of this documentation. So in that case, 
please [come and talk to us on Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org).
