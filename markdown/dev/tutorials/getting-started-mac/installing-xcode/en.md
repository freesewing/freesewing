title: Installing the Xcode command line tools
order: 10
---

Before we can get started, we need some basic tools for development.
They are bundled in the *Xcode command-line tools* so let's install
that first.

Open the Terminal application, and type the following command:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

A popup will appear asking you to confirm the installation.
Confirm, and go make a cup of coffee while the install does its thing.
