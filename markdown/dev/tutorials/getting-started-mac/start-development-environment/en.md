You will have a new folder that has the name you picked for your pattern.
If you chose `test`, you will have a `test` folder. If you chose `banana`, you'll have a `banana` folder.

If you enter that folder, you'll find a couple of subfolders:

-   `config` holds your pattern's configuration file
-   `src` holds your pattern's source code
-   `example` holds the development environment

To start the development environment, enter the `example` folder and run: `npm run start` (or `yarn start` if you're using Yarn as a package manager.

The development environment will watch for any changes you make to
the pattern's source code. When you do, it will update automatically in your browser.

Thankfully, we have a tutorial for that too:
