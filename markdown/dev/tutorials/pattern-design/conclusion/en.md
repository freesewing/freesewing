Congratulations, you have created your first pattern. And while it's arguably rather simple, 
you have learned a bunch of things along the way. Let's list some of the things you've learned:

 - You have learned how to [setup your development environment](/tutorials/pattern-design/create-freesewing-pattern) with `npx create-freesewing-pattern`
 - You learned how to [add parts](/tutorials/pattern-design/your-first-part), [measurements](/tutorials/pattern-design/adding-measurements), and [options](/tutorials/pattern-design/adding-options) to your pattern's configuration file
 - You learned what [a good boilerplate is to start with a new part](/tutorials/pattern-design/part-structure)
 - You've learned [how to add points and draw paths](/tutorials/pattern-design/constructing-the-neck-opening)
 - You learned how you can make changes in a loop to [adapt the neck opening](/tutorials/pattern-design/fitting-the-neck-opening) or [rotate the straps](/tutorials/pattern-design/avoiding-overlap) until they were just right
 - You learned about [macros and how to use them](/tutorials/pattern-design/creating-the-closure)
 - You learned different methods to manipulate [points](/reference/api/point/) and [paths](/reference/api/path/)
 - You learned about using [attributes](/reference/api/attributes/) to influence the appearance of points and paths
 - Your learned about what it means to draft [a complete pattern](/tutorials/pattern-design/completing-your-pattern)
 - Your learned about [snippets and how to add them](/tutorials/pattern-design/completing-your-pattern#adding-snippets)
 - You learned [how to offset a path](/tutorials/pattern-design/completing-your-pattern#seam-allowance) to create seam allowance, or in our case, mark the bias tape line
 - You learned how to create a [paperless pattern](/tutorials/pattern-design/paperless-bib) by adding dimensions

You can find the complete code of the tutorial pattern [here on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/blob/develop/packages/tutorial/src/bib.js).

## More reading material

 - If you haven't done so already, read through [the pattern guide](/guides/patterns/) which provides a good overview of how patterns work under the hood
 - Bookmark [the FreeSewing API docs](/reference/api/), they are your reference every time you're not entirely certain how something works
 - Have a look at [the design guide](/guides/best-practices/) for best practices that will help you make the best possible patterns

## What to do next

Now that you have learned how to create a pattern, why don't you make one?

Think about what it is you would like to create, and just do it. If you get stuck at any moment,
