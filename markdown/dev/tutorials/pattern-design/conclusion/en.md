Congratulations, you have created your first pattern. And while it's arguably rather simple,
you have learned a bunch of things along the way. Let's list some of the things you've learned:

-   You learned how to [setup your development environment](/tutorials/pattern-design/create-freesewing-pattern) with `npx create-freesewing-pattern`
-   You learned how to [add parts](/tutorials/pattern-design/your-first-part), [measurements](/tutorials/pattern-design/adding-measurements), and [options](/tutorials/pattern-design/adding-options) to your pattern's configuration file
-   You learned what [a good boilerplate is to start with a new part](/tutorials/pattern-design/part-structure)
-   You learned [how to add points and draw paths](/tutorials/pattern-design/constructing-the-neck-opening)
-   You learned how you can make changes in a loop to [adapt the neck opening](/tutorials/pattern-design/fitting-the-neck-opening) or [rotate the straps](/tutorials/pattern-design/avoiding-overlap) until they were just right
-   You learned about [macros and how to use them](/tutorials/pattern-design/creating-the-closure)
-   You learned different methods to manipulate [points](/reference/api/point/) and [paths](/reference/api/path/)
-   You learned about using [attributes](/reference/api/attributes/) to influence the appearance of points and paths
-   You learned about what it means to draft [a complete pattern](/tutorials/pattern-design/completing-your-pattern)
-   You learned about [snippets and how to add them](/tutorials/pattern-design/completing-your-pattern#adding-snippets)
-   You learned [how to offset a path](/tutorials/pattern-design/completing-your-pattern#seam-allowance) to create seam allowance, or in our case, mark the bias tape line
-   You learned how to create a [paperless pattern](/tutorials/pattern-design/paperless-bib) by adding dimensions

You can find the complete code of the tutorial pattern [here on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/blob/develop/packages/tutorial/src/bib.js).

## More reading material

-   If you haven't done so already, read through [the pattern guide](/guides/patterns/) which provides a good overview of how patterns work under the hood
-   Bookmark [the FreeSewing API docs](/reference/api/), they are your reference every time you're not entirely certain how something works
-   Have a look at [the design guide](/guides/best-practices/) for best practices that will help you make the best possible patterns

## What to do next

Now that you have learned how to create a pattern, why don't you make one?

Think about what it is you would like to create, and just do it. If you get stuck at any moment,
or need some help or advice, you can [join our chat room](https://discord.freesewing.org/) and we'll help you out.

If you need some ideas or want to help on a pattern design take a look [at these open projects](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/discussions?discussions_q=label%3A%22%3Ashirt%3A+pattern+design%22+label%3A%22%3A%2B1%3A+good+first+issue%22) for patterns which are currently being worked on and are good patterns for a first time contributor to have a go at!
