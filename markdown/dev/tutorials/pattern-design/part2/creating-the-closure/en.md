title: Creating the closure
order: 91
---

Things are starting to look good, but we can't fit the bib over the baby's head like this.
So we must create a closure. We'll let the straps overlap at the end, and put in a snap
later.

## Using macros

To round the straps, we'll use something new: **a macro**. To use macros, we
need the `macro` method, which we can destructure to get access to it.

Macros are little helpers that automate things that would otherwise get rather
tedious. There are macros to add titles to our pattern, or grainline
indicators, a scalebox, and there's a macro to round corners. The `round`
macro.

<Note> You can find more information on the `round` macro in [the macros docs](/reference/macros/round/).</Note>

We need a half circle here, but the `round` macro works on 90Â° angles, so
we'll use it twice.  As such, we'll add some points to guide the macro, and
then put it to work.

Like our neck opening, we've only drawn half since we can simply copy the
points to the other side.
