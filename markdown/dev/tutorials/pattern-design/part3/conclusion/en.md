Congratulations, we have created our first pattern. And while it's arguably
rather simple, we have learned a bunch of things along the way. 

## More reading material

- If you haven't done so already, read through [the pattern
  guide](/guides/patterns/) which provides a good overview of how patterns work
  under the hood
- Bookmark [the FreeSewing API docs](/reference/api/), they are your reference
  every time you're not entirely certain how something works
- Have a look at [the design guide](/guides/best-practices/) for best practices
  that will help you make the best possible patterns

## What to do next

Now that you have learned how to create a pattern, why don't you make one?

Think about what it is you would like to create, and just do it. If you get
stuck at any moment, or need some help or advice, you can [join our chat
room](https://discord.freesewing.org/) and we'll help you out.

##### How did I do?

You could do me a real favor by letting me know what you loved or hated about
this tutorial.

Were there areas that were not clear? Did I dwell too long on one topic, or
rushed through another one too quickly?  Your feedback helps improve things,
so don't be shy and tell me what you think.
