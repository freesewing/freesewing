Much like garments themselves, patterns are made up of *parts*. 

Most patterns will have multiple parts. A sleeve, a back part, the collar, and so on.
Our pattern is very simple, and only has one part: the bib.

The pattern that's been created for us also just has one part to get you started.
It's called **box** and it draws a box. If you click on the **Draft your pattern**
button in your browser, you'll get to see it:

![The default pattern with its box part](./step1.png)

Since we only need one part, we'll rename this *box* part, and call it *bib*.

## Rename the box part to bib

First, update the configuration file in `config/index.js`.
Update the **parts** array with `bib`, rather than `box`:

```js
parts: ["bib"],
```

When that's done, rename the `src/box.js` file into `src/bib.js`.

Then, in the `src/index.js` file, change the import accordingly:

```js
// Change this line
//import draftBox from "./box";

// Into this
import draftBib from "./bib";
```

Finally, still in the `src/index.js` file, update the draftmethod:

```js
// Change this line
//Pattern.prototype.draftBox = draftBox;

// Into this
Pattern.prototype.draftBib = draftBib;
```

<Tip>

###### Always use draftPartname

FreeSewing will expect for each part to find a method named Draft*Partname*.

If you have a part named `sleeve` you should have a method called `draftSleeve()` that drafts that part.

In our case, we have a part named `bib` so we're using `draftBib()` as the method that drafts it.

</Tip>

Congratulations, your pattern now has a `bib` part, rather than a `box` part. 
It still looks the same though:

<Example pattern="tutorial" part="step1" caption="Our bib part, which is the renamed box part" />

This `bib` part is where we'll do some real work. But first, we have some more configuration to do.
