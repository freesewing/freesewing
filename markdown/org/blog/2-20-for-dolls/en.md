I'm happy to announce that we've released FreeSewing 2.20, which comes with a feature request that was on our roadmap: Better support for doll clothes.
We have some passionate doll enthusiasts in our community which make sense when you consider that our patterns adapt seamlessly to all sorts of measurements, including those of dolls.

But there's another issue that comes up when generating these tiny patterns, that is that while the pattern itself adapts to the doll measurements, things like font sizes and arrows and logos do not.
That causes doll patterns to look like a chaotic mess as the things that are typically taking up just a bit of space tend to overwhelm the actual pattern:

![Image showing a doll pattern with snippets and text scaled down](https://posts.freesewing.org/uploads/post_scale_5a422f8c73.png "This is the same Aaron in 2.20. As you can see, it's much better")

To make this happen, we've added [a new scale setting](/docs/guide/options/scale) that you can find under *Advanced* after enabling *Expert mode*.
We hope those of you making doll clothes will find this useful, and as always [we look forward to hearing your feedback](https://discord.freesewing.org/).
