What do you do if your daughter needed an apron for school?

 - Would you run out to the store and buy one?
 - Would you fire up your sewing machine and make one?
 - Would you say to yourself _hmm, better make a pattern first_ and then
   share your FreeSewing pattern so that now everybody can have an apron?

Because [that's what Wouter did](/showcase/albert-by-wouter/), so we wrapped it
into FreeSewing v2.10, and [voila](/designs/albert/).
