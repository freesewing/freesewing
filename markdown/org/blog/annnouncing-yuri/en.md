I'm happy to announce the immediate availability of FreeSewing v2.18 and our latest addition to our catalog of designs: [The Yuri hoodie](/designs/yuri/) . 
Designed by [Hellgy](https://twitter.com/hellgy) and coded by their bae [Biou](https://github.com/biou/), Yuri is everything they love about [our Huey hoodie](/designs/huey/) sans their arch enemy: zippers.

Checkout [Hellgy's showcase for more pictures](/showcase/yuri-by-its-designer), or check out [the pattern page itself](/designs/yuri/) for all details.
