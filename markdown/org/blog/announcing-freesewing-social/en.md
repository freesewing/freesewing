FreeSewing has carved out a spaced for itself on the Fediverse and that space is [FreeSewing.social](https://freesewing.social). It's a Mastodon instance that is open to all FreeSewing users, and the larger community.
## The FreeSewing Mastodon instance
The official FreeSewing account ([@freesewing@freesewing.social](https://freesewing.social/@freesewing)) will be used for formal announcements, so if you want the headlines, follow that one.

I will be using my own account ([@joost@freesewing.social](https://freesewing.social/@joost)) for more frequent updates, news, discussion and whatnot. So if you'd like to be more in the loop, that's a good one to follow.

And -- it bears repeating -- you are welcome to join this instance. If you were wondering about Mastodon/Fediverse but were not too sure about what to do or what server to join, this is your chance.

## Leaving Twitter
I need more work like I need another hole in my head, so setting up this instance was something I've been mulling over for a while, but in the end I decided to do it because Twitter -- where both FreeSewing and myself have an account -- has been transformed into something that I honestly don't want to have anything to do with.

This has been going on for a while, and leaving Twitter at this point is not exactly a strong statement. It's just that I've been busy, and certainly was too busy to deal with this. So I decided that the website migration was a good time to make the formal announcement.

So, I will remove both `@j__st` and `@freesewing_org` from Twitter at the end of this month. 

## Joining Bluesky
The Fediverse is not for everyone, and for those who like the Twitter experience, Bluesky seems to be the alternative that is somewhat closest.

This is by no means an endorsement, but I have created [joost.at](https://bsky.app/profile/joost.at) and [FreeSewing.org](https://bsky.app/profile/freesewing.org) on Bluesky. I will do my best to also post there so that those people who prefer it can get their updates that way.
