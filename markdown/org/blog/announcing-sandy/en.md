Ladies and gentlemen --- because who says men can't wear skirts --- I am happy to announce the immeadiate availability of our latest freesewing pattern: [the Sandy circle skirt](/patterns/sandy).

Sandy was designed by [@AlfaLyr](/users/alfalyr) who really did a stellar job. This makes it also another pattern from the freesewing community, something that I'm very excited about.

## All the options

As many patterns here at freesewing, Sandy comes with a bunch of options to allow you to customize your skirt to your wishes.

There's options for how much of circle you want (half? full? Something else?), how long you want it, the shape and overlap of the waistband, whether you want pleats, how much hem, and so on.

I can see this becoming rather the success story.  
So go and [treat yourself to a new skirt](/draft/sandy), and let [@AlfyLyr](/users/alfalyr) know how it works out for you.
