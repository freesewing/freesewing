A while ago I found myself in need of some new swim trunks. So I drafted a pattern and made some:

![An early tryout of the Shin pattern](https://posts.freesewing.org/uploads/sample_0437fef846.jpg)

I asked if people would be interested in a pattern like this, and turns out that yes, they were.

So, after some more tweaking, I think this is ready for you guys, and meanwhile Roy
has already provided an illustration for it too.

## Options and documentation available

Shin comes with options, and they are very close to the options available for 
[Bruce](/designs/bruce).

All [options are documented](/docs/patterns/shin/options), 
as are the [required measurements](/docs/patterns/shin/measurements), 
and I've also written [instructions for how to make this](/docs/patterns/shin). 

I still have to do the illustrations, but it's really not hard so you'll probably
figure it out without them.
Essentially, you can go and make this right now.

Enjoy!
