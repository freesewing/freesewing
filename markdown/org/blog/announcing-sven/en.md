Winter caused me to design this pattern. I was cold, and needed some sweaters, so what does one do?

Sven stayed under the radar until now because I designed it on the (then unreleased) freesewing platform, and until now I didn't have a place to show it to people.

That's how we got here. Now about that sweater: It's a simple design based on the Brian body block. I've made three different version myself, changing the neckline and fabrics, and it really does what it needs to do very well (as in, keep me warm).
