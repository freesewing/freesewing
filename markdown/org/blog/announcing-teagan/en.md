A while ago somebody asked whether we had a T-shirt pattern on freesewing.org and it turns out, we didn't.
 
There's no good reason for that, we just never got around to that.
So today we're rolling out version 2.9 of FreeSewing with our latest pattern: [the Teagan T-shirt](/designs/teagan/).

## Who is this for?

Teagan is fitted T-shirt pattern with options for altering the neckline, length, and sleeves.

Teagan is based on [our Brian block](/designs/brian/), which does not take breasts into account. 
That being said, this will work for people with breasts too. 
Since it uses the chest circumference it will simply draft a T-shirt to fit your full chest. 

We've also added an option to draft this to your high bust, which would give you a more fitted T-shirt 
with ease & stretch having to accomodate for your breasts.
