We've just published a new pattern on this website: [Bella, a bodice block for womenswear](/designs/bella/).
It's a block with bust and waist dart, and a waist dart at the back.

My goal when venturing into womenswear was to make one foundational block from which 
we could then spin out a range of different garments.

Which is why we have [Breanna](/designs/breanna/), which I designed from scratch.
Unfortunately, it hasn't been the end-all be-all that I — perhaps naively — hoped it would be.

For Bella, I worked with someone from the industry to implement a design that is commonly
used for commercial garment making. As such, I am curious to see how this one will pan out.

My initial plan was to also make a variation with a shoulder dart at the front, to replace the bust dart,
but in the end I settled for getting it released, rather than work on it longer.

Which brings me to:

##### I'm taking a break from womenswear

I feel like I'm expending a lot of effort here for little result.
It's getting me down, and I need a win.

I want to work on something that I can not only design, but also make and wear.
Something that gives me joy, and makes me feel like I know what I'm doing.

So while I'll still help out people who want to design for women themselves,
I am taking a break from womenswear.
