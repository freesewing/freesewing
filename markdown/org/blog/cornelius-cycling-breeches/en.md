[Wouter](https://www.instagram.com/wouter.vdub/) is at it again, this time around he's treating us to classic cycling breeches.

He writes:

> When I was a child my dad would tell me stories about hiking in the mountains, something magical for a kid living in The Netherlands. 
> He had a suitcase with his mountaineering things in it, and part of that were some 'knickerbockers', baggy trousers that reached down to your calves. 
>
> When I moved to the USA in my thirties and started hiking myself, I would often reflect on those talks and felt sad that I didn't inherit those knickerbockers. 
> Then when I discovered sewing, I decided I would make myself a pair, but no good patterns presented themselves. 
>
> This year someone on the Freesewing discord server posted a link to The 'Keystone' Systems, Practical methods of cutting, from around the turn of the century. 
> This contained a drafting system for 'Cycling Breeches', which seemed to be close to what my father used to wear, and could be translated into a Freesewing pattern. 
> A project was born, and I'm happy to be able to present the results to you.

As Wouter mentioned; This pattern is based on [the Keystone drafting method](https://archive.org/details/keystonesystemsc00heck/page/n5/mode/2up).
Not that it matters because as always you get it made-to-measure for 
you [right here on FreeSewing.org](/designs/cornelius/).

![Here's the man himself](https://posts.freesewing.org/uploads/wouter_9fbc821146.jpg)

Note that you don't have to cycle to wear these. 
All that's required is a willingness to show of those socks (or calfs).

Cornelius is available at [/designs/cornelius/](/designs/cornelius/).
