After last month's release of [Benjamin](/patterns/benjamin), here's another pattern release
to channel the dapper gentleman within: the [Florent Flat Cap](/patterns/florent).

Like Benjamin, this pattern was contributed by the freesewing community, rather than
yours truly. In this case, it was [Quentin Felix](/users/ptzcb) who signed for the design.

I asked Quentin if he wanted to write this announcement blog post himself, 
but he argued that it was time I did something too. He did have this to share
though, on his reasons for designing this pattern in the first place:

> ##### Quentin on his reasons for designing Florent
>
> I like wearing flat caps myself. I didn't use to, but I have
> a friend Florent who inspired me to wear them (now you know where the name comes from).
>
>
> The first time I made a flat cap, it took me ages to scale the 
> pattern to an exact fit, involving a lot of messing about with tracing paper.
> There's a number of patterns available online for flat caps.
> But they all come in one size only. 
>
> I wanted to make this more accessible to people. And, while I was at it,
> I also drew on my experience to add some tweaks for a better fit. 
>
> For example, this design extends lower at the back of the head, which
> gives it better hold.

This *why should we always have to re-invent the wheel?* could
pretty much be freesewing's slogan.

## It's the season for giving

Florent requires only one measurement: the head circumference. As such,
this release is perfectly timed. With the holiday season coming up,
here's another gift you can make yourself.

Thanks Quentin!
