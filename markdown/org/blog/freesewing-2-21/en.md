We've rolled out FreeSewing v2.21 today, and it's a massive update with tons of changes, improvements, and behind the scenes work.
Check the CHANGELOG if you'd like get all the nitty-gritty detail. For this blog post, I'll focus on what you are probably going to be most interested in: New designs.

This release brings 5 new designs to our catalog, so let's dive right in:

## Bob is a bib

We've been using the construction of a Bib pattern in our [pattern design tutorial](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/pattern-design) for years.
Yet we never added the pattern to our catalog. An oversight that's been corrected now, and we now carry [Bob the bib](/designs/bob) in our collection.

Perfect for babies and grown-ups who are messy eaters alike, since you can make Bob in any size.

## Hi is a shark

It's been kinda hard to contain our excitement about this, but hear me out: A while ago rumours started swirling that IKEA would discontinue it's [BLÅHAJ](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/blahaj-soft-toy-shark-90373590/) stuffed shark, which is a universally beloved toy.

The FreeSewing community wasn't just going to idly stand by while the worlds friendliest shark ran the risk of becoming extinct.
A conservation effort gained momentum, and ultimately Wouter matter-of-factively dropped the first **Hi** pictures in our Discord.

Oh, and you should know that [Hi](/designs/hi)  can be made big or small. The patterns scales up to a 5m shark. What are you waiting for?

## Lucy is a tie-on pocket

We've seen a number of historical designs recently, specifically from Starf. This time around, it's SeaZeeZee who added [Lucy](/designs/lucy) which is a pattern for a tie-on pocket.

It's a quick make for cosplay, historical re-enactment, or for all those dresses that don't come with pockets.

## Noble is a body block with prince(ss) seams

Wouter (of Hi fame) has another contribution in this release: Noble is a princess seam body block.
Blocks tend to be undervalued but they are the foundation that other designs are built on, so having a new body block with prince(ss) seams is very exciting.

## Unice is for undies

[Unice](/designs/unice) is a variant of [Ursula](/desgns/ursula), another undies pattern. It was designed by Anna who describes it as *the undies for those with significant rear estate*.

It has a few changes and tweaks in comparison to Ursula, and is specifically intended to fit *any* body. So if you're rear estate mogul, try these out.
