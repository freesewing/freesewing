Earlier this week, [AlfaLyr](/users/alfalyr) wrote to us to say that she had made a pattern
for the iconic Sherlock Holmes Deerstalker hat, based on this YouTube tutorial 
by [Bernadette Banner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHtaUm-FjUps090S7crO4Q):

Unfortunately, we were just rounding 
up [the rollout of v2.2 of FreeSewing](/blog/breanna-measurements-sizes-in-2-2/), and it was
too late to squeeze in this extra pattern.

But obviously we love this hat, not to mention that it is the perfect accessory for
our [Carlton](/designs/carlton/) and [Carlita](/designs/carlita/) patterns. So here it
is, [FreeSewing 2.3](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
with [the new Holmes pattern](/designs/holmes/).

Enjoy!
