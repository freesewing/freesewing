This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.

## Looking back at April

Did you get them? All those emails, notifications, and popups from companies informing you
that they've made some changes to their privacy policy, or the way they handle your data,
and would you please agree to these changes?

I bet you did, as did I. And with each one of them, I grow a bit more nervous as the 
GDPR deadline of May 25th is approaching, yet I'm not ready yet to send you one of those emails.

Our [carefully laid plans](/blog/gdpr-plan/) are but a small part of the changes we're working on,
and that's why it's all taking a bit longer than expected.

I could write a bit more about it, but I've got a ton of work to do and very little time to do it in.
So if it's all the same, I think I'd rather get back to work.

## Looking ahead to May

Expect changes. A lot of changes. Nothing to worry about though ðŸ˜‰
