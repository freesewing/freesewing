This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.

## Looking back at May

Well here we are, the GPPR deadline of May 25th is getting smaller and smaller in 
our rear-view mirror, and we have a new website.

Both of those things are obviously related, but you probably [already knew that](/blog/gdpr-ready).

May has been an incredibly hectic month, with a lot of self-inflicted stress because rather
than just implement the changes required for GDPR, we decided to rebuild the entire site.
However, as the GDPR changes needed to be ready in time, that meant that the entire site had to
be ready. 

*Ready* is obviously open to interpretation, and even though we published the site on time
— with 1.5 hours to spare to be precise — there were still a few loose ends left and right.

We've fixed a bunch of those and I'd like to thank all of you who reported issues and helped us 
fix them by sharing their experience. 

A lot of time and effort has been invested in making the site multi-lingual, and it's been great
to be able to launch with three langauges enabled. All the translators are doing great work
and I hope we'll be able to turn on a few other langauges relatively soon.

Apart from [open issues](https://github.com/freesewing/site/issues), 
we also still have to port some of the documentation to the new site,
which is something that we'll continue to work on in June. Speaking of which:

## Looking ahead to June

Don't expect any ground breaking changes in June. We're going to keep on ironing out the 
last kinks on the site, and continue to port the remaining documentation that's still
missing from the site.

I can't — and won't — make any promises and expect other people to keep them, so while I can't 
commit to any translation work, great strides are being made in the French and Swedish translations,
so that's all very exciting.

I'm also thrilled that this translation work is turning out to be a good on-ramp for people
with no prior experience as open source contributors. Not only that, but translators are now
actually fixing small bugs left and right which is really terrific.

Obviously there's a lot of work that remains to be done, so if you're still standing on the
sidelines wondering whether this is something for you, don't be shy.
