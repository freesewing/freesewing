This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, 
and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.

## Looking back at June

After the mad scramble in May to get the new site ready for the GDPR deadline,
June has (thankfully) been a bit let hectic. 

Not that we haven't been busy. We've resolved a few issues with the new site,
and while there's a few things that still need work, the most pressing issues have been resolved.

We've also completed the port of the documentation, which was something that was on our
todo-list for June.
It's always nice to make a plan and then follow through on it.

With the migration demanding less of our time and attention, we've turned our attention
back to building our pattern repository, and just before the end of the month, we were
able to publish the [Penelope Pencil Skirt](/patterns/penelope).

The pattern was designed by [@woutervdub](/users/woutervdub), it's his second pattern
after he previously made [Benjamin](/patterns/benjamin).

To make certain the release wouldn't go unnoticed, we asked freesewing's illustrator 
[Roy van der Hel](https://www.deviantart.com/royvdhel-art) to drew an illustration
for Penelope, and as always, he nailed it.

![Fun fact: Roy van der Hel means: Roy from Hel, and that's his real name](penelope.jpg)

Oh, and I'd almost forgot. The website is now available in German, so 
tell your German-speaking friends about it!

## Looking ahead to July

As you could read in the [Penelope announcement blog post](/blog/announcing-penelope) we
are planning more womenswear patterns, and that's what our focus will be on in July.

Some of those plans are more mid-term, but we should be releasing a circle skirt pattern
in July designed by [@AlfaLyr](/users/alfalyr), who also provided much of the Spanish translation
of the site.

We also started working on a basic bodice block for women, but that will probably take a while
to complete.

Watch this space.
