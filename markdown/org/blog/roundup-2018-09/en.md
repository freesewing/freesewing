This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, 
and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.

## Looking back at September

GitHub tells me that I've made 329 commits in 32 repositories during September. 
Most of that work is an investment in the future, and it will be a while before you'll
be able to reap the benefits of it. 

But not all, because between all the other stuff, I did find time to release the
[Shin swim trunk pattern](/patterns/shin):

### Pics or it didn't happen

Also new are a bunch of showcases, which is always nice, including this
Jaeger jacket by [Paul](/users/Tiger751023):

If you're making our patterns, please don't hesitate to send in your pictures so we can add some more!

### Shadow boxing

All the other work has mostly been JavaScript code as part of our future plans.
I am aware that this kind of work is invisible to most of you (you don't stalk mmy on GitHub, do you?)
and that the perception can be that not much is going on here.

The opposite is true. I am working harder on this project than ever, but for now it's mostly in the shadows.

To try shine some light on what's going on, 
I have created [a long todo-list](https://github.com/freesewing/todo),
so if you'd like to help out (or if you're just curious what we're up to) go ahead and have a look.

Note that not all tasks are technical. We also need to pick pretty colors for the new patterns for example.


## Looking ahead to October

I have two weeks of holiday in October, and I have promised myself I would (try to)
put away my laptop and make some clothes. I'm curious to see how that goes.
