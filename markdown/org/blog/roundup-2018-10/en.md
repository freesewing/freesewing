This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, 
and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.

## Looking back at October

Skeletons pack up their rattling chains, and your *sexy Brett Kavanaugh* costume
has found a new home in the attic. This can only mean one thing: Halloween is over,
here comes November.

I am currently under the influence of influenza, so pardon me if I keep this short.

What I can tell you about October is that a lot of work has been done, and while it's not 
always obvious to somehow showcase this behind-the-scenes work, 
[our beta website](https://beta.freesewing.org/) is 
slowly starting to gain more and more features.

Not that we're anything close to finishing it. But you can login with your current freesewing
username and password. Which means that we've successfully migrated all our data to our new backend.

It's baby steps, but with each passing day, and each line of code written, we get a little closer
to where we want to go.

## Looking ahead to November

In early December we traditionally do our yearly roundup, which means that November is kind of 
that last month we have to come up with something to show off.

I've somehow made peace with the fact that things won't be nearly as ready as I'd like them to be.
But on the other hand, I am still excited about all the work we are doing/have been doing, so 
hopefully that will shine through regardless of whether we can show you much or not.

Now if you don't mind, I'll get back to tea and tissues.
