This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, 
and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.

## Looking back at November

I have been very busy this month, but more about that in our roundup post for the year
which you can expect on December 10th.

Because I've been busy, a few showcase posts had fallen through the cracks.
I've cleared the backlog in my inbox now, and as a result we have 
[a new Bruce showcase by Felix](/en/showcase/bruce-three-pack) and
[a new Sandy showcase by Karin](/en/showcase/sandy-by-karin).

If you've made one of our patterns, make sure to send in your pictures 
so we can add them too. I mean, even if it takes a while, I do eventually
get around to it :)


Earlier this week, I woke to the unsettling news that a popular package on 
NPM [had been hijacked by malicious actors](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/hacker-backdoors-widely-used-open-source-software-to-steal-bitcoin/).

That's obviously shitty behaviour, but the fact that this package is a dependency
of our backend (as in, we use it) made for a rude awakening.
Our backend was patched by the time I got to work (yay for trains), but as more information
came to light, it turned out it was never a problem in the first place.

For one thing, the dependency was a so-called development dependency. Code that is included
while developing, but not included in the production build.

Furthermore, the malicious actors were targetting a very specific set of people in order
to make off with their bitcoin, so there was never an issue.

As the story was developing, we 
[posted updates on Twitter](https://twitter.com/freesewing_org/status/1067312509672177664)
