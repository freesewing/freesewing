Dit is je maandelijkse samenvatting van het freeswing-nieuws van de afgelopen vier weken, en een blik op wat er de komende maand in het verschiet ligt.

## Terugblik op november

I have been very busy this month, but more about that in our roundup post for the year which you can expect on December 10th.

Because I've been busy, a few showcase posts had fallen through the cracks. I've cleared the backlog in my inbox now, and as a result we have [a new Bruce showcase by Felix](/en/showcase/bruce-three-pack) and [a new Sandy showcase by Karin](/en/showcase/sandy-by-karin).

If you've made one of our patterns, make sure to send in your pictures so we can add them too. I mean, even if it takes a while, I do eventually get around to it :)


Earlier this week, I woke to the unsettling news that a popular package on NPM [had been hijacked by malicious actors](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/hacker-backdoors-widely-used-open-source-software-to-steal-bitcoin/).

That's obviously shitty behaviour, but the fact that this package is a dependency of our backend (as in, we use it) made for a rude awakening. Our backend was patched by the time I got to work (yay for trains), but as more information came to light, it turned out it was never a problem in the first place.

For one thing, the dependency was a so-called development dependency. Code that is included while developing, but not included in the production build.

Furthermore, the malicious actors were targetting a very specific set of people in order to make off with their bitcoin, so there was never an issue.

As the story was developing, we [posted updates on Twitter](https://twitter.com/freesewing_org/status/1067312509672177664) so if you want to make sure you want to hear all the latest news, make sure to follow [@freesewing_org](https://twitter.com/freesewing_org) on Twitter.


## Vooruitkijken naar december

In early December we traditionally do our yearly roundup, so more on that soon :)
