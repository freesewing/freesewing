We have released version 2.22 of FreeSewing. As always, a minor version bump indicates a new design, and this time it's the [Octoplushy design](/designs/octoplushy) by Wouter.

Version 2.22 is planned to be the last minor release in the v2 branch. Momentum for version 3 has been building for a while, and during [this weekend's contributor call](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/discussions/2582) we decided we'd double down on those efforts and focus all our attention on the upcoming version 3.

## What does this all mean?

In the short term, you might not even notice. FreeSewing.org will continue running the production-ready v2 code, while we start building version 3.

For developers and/or pattern designers, the situation is different. Effective immediately, our (default) `develop` branch in [our monorepo](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing) is where we'll be working on version 3 code.
Version 2 code is now in the `v2` branch where will will backport fixes for as long as version 3 is under development.

To keep up to date of all changes, please refer to [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev) where we will over time document everything you need to know about the migration.

## When can we expect version 3?

We have a lot of exciting plans, but they will take some time to manifest. I suspect the first production release of version 3 code, and the rollout on FreeSewing.org will be a matter for 2023.
