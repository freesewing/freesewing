## Â¿QuÃ© es FreeSewing?

FreeSewing is the leading [open source library](https://github.com/freesewing) for on-demand garment manufacturing.  
Loved by home sewers and fashion entrepreneurs alike, FreeSewing provides the tech stack for your creative endeavours.

FreeSewing is the brain-child of [Joost De Cock](https://github.com/joostdecock), the FreeSewing maintainer. Various other people have contributed to FreeSewing over the years (the [FreeSewing contributors](/contributors)), and the project is financially supported by [the FreeSewing patrons](/patrons).

<Tip>

For more info about FreeSewing -- the open source project -- refer to
[FreeSewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/) which hosts documentation for
developers, designers, contributors, and translators.

## What is FreeSewing.org?

Freesewing.org is the FreeSewing project's flagship website where we offer our ever-growing collection of bespoke sewing patterns to makers all over the world.

FreeSewing is not about fashion, trends, or publishing the hot new pattern of the season. Instead, we want to empower makers by distilling the knowledge of the sewing community into parametric designs + documentation, and make that information freely available.

FreeSewing.org is our most visible asset, and for many people their first encounter with the FreeSewing project.

## Patterns vs Designs

If you came to this site looking for _sewing patterns_ and did not immeadiatly find a place to download them, that's because all of FreeSewing's sewing patterns are **made to measure**.

No escalamos ni clasificamos patrones. Instead, FreeSewing drafts a design into a pattern made to your measurements. Eso sucede en tiempo real, en tu navegador.

- **Design**: One of the styles that we offer. We've got dozens of designs, and you can try them all
- **Pattern**: The result of *drafting the design* (turning it into a sewing pattern to your measurements). Tenemos miles de patrones almacenados para nuestros usuarios, y algunos pueden ser tuyos

<Tip>

##### Saving is optional

When you generate a bespoke pattern, you can tweak it endlessly through its various options,
and export it to a range of formats, including PDF.  
But it remains ephemeral until you save it to your account, so it
becomes one of **your patterns**.

Saving your pattern is optional, but it allows you to re-visit the pattern later, make further tweaks to it or simply download the PDF again.

Puedes guardar tantos patrones como quieras.

<Note>

##### We respect the strictest privacy laws on the planet
To generate bespoke sewing patterns, we need your measurements.
Asking for them every time would be rather tedious, so we store them in your account.

Your account data is stored on our backend, subject to [our privacy notice](/docs/about/privacy),
and with respect for [your rights](docs/about/rights/).

</Note>

## Measurements sets

Una vez que tenga una cuenta, puede comenzar a agregar mediciones. But that quickly brings up the next question: what if you want a pattern for you, but also for your partner?

That's why we have **measurements sets**. You can add as many measurements sets as you like. Tener sÃ³lo uno para ti tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ bien.

<Tip>

##### Curated measurements sets

FreeSewing also provides **curated measurements sets**. These are measurements set from real people that we use to test our platform and designs. But you can also use them to test-drive our platform before you break out the measuring tape.
