## –©–æ —Ç–∞–∫–µ FreeSewing?

FreeSewing is the leading [open source library](https://github.com/freesewing) for on-demand garment manufacturing.  
Loved by home sewers and fashion entrepreneurs alike, FreeSewing provides the tech stack for your creative endeavours.

FreeSewing is the brain-child of [Joost De Cock](https://github.com/joostdecock), the FreeSewing maintainer. Various other people have contributed to FreeSewing over the years (the [FreeSewing contributors](/contributors)), and the project is financially supported by [the FreeSewing patrons](/patrons).

For more info about FreeSewing -- the open source project -- refer to
[FreeSewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/) which hosts documentation for
developers, designers, contributors, and translators.

## What is FreeSewing.org?

Freesewing.org is the FreeSewing project's flagship website where we offer our ever-growing collection of bespoke sewing patterns to makers all over the world.

FreeSewing is not about fashion, trends, or publishing the hot new pattern of the season. –ù–∞—Ç–æ–º—ñ—Å—Ç—å –º–∏ —Ö–æ—á–µ–º–æ –Ω–∞–¥–∞—Ç–∏ –∫—Ä–∞–≤—Ü—è–º —Å–ø—ñ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Ç—É —Ç–∞ —ó—ó –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—è, –Ω–∞ –±–∞–∑—ñ —è–∫–∏—Ö –±—É–¥—É—é—Ç—å—Å—è –Ω–∞—à—ñ –≤–∏–∫—Ä—ñ–π–∫–∏ —Ç–∞ –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü—ñ—è, —Ç–∞ –∑—Ä–æ–±–∏—Ç–∏ —Ü—é —ñ–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü—ñ—é –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω–æ—é.

FreeSewing.org is our most visible asset, and for many people their first encounter with the FreeSewing project.

## Patterns vs Designs

If you came to this site looking for _sewing patterns_ and did not immeadiatly find a place to download them, that's because all of FreeSewing's sewing patterns are **made to measure**.

–ú–∏ –Ω–µ –º–∞—Å—à—Ç–∞–±—É—î–º–æ –≤–∏–∫—Ä—ñ–π–∫–∏ —Ç–∞ –Ω–µ –≥—Ä–∞–¥—É—é—î–º–æ –ª–µ–∫–∞–ª–∞. Instead, FreeSewing drafts a design into a pattern made to your measurements. –¶–µ —Ç—Ä–∞–ø–ª—è—î—Ç—å—Å—è –Ω–∞–∂–∏–≤—É —É –í–∞—à–æ–º—É –±—Ä–∞—É–∑–µ—Ä—ñ.

- **Design**: One of the styles that we offer. We've got dozens of designs, and you can try them all
- **Pattern**: The result of *drafting the design* (turning it into a sewing pattern to your measurements). –ú–∏ –º–∞—î–º–æ —Ç–∏—Å—è—á—ñ –≤–∏–∫—Ä—ñ–π–æ–∫, —â–æ –∑–±–µ—Ä—ñ–≥–∞—é—Ç—å—Å—è –¥–ª—è –Ω–∞—à–∏—Ö –∫–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—É–≤–∞—á—ñ–≤, —ñ –¥–µ—è–∫—ñ –∑ –Ω–∏—Ö –º–æ–∂—É—Ç—å –±—É—Ç–∏ –í–∞—à–∏–º–∏

##### Saving is optional

When you generate a bespoke pattern, you can tweak it endlessly through its various options,
and export it to a range of formats, including PDF.  
But it remains ephemeral until you save it to your account, so it
becomes one of **your patterns**.

##### We respect the strictest privacy laws on the planet
To generate bespoke sewing patterns, we need your measurements.
Asking for them every time would be rather tedious, so we store them in your account.

Your account data is stored on our backend, subject to [our privacy notice](/docs/about/privacy),
and with respect for [your rights](docs/about/rights/).

## Measurements sets

That's why we have **measurements sets**. You can add as many measurements sets as you like. –ú–∞—Ç–∏ –ª–∏—à–µ –æ–¥–Ω—É –¥–ª—è —Å–µ–±–µ ‚Äî —Ç–µ–∂ —Ñ–∞–π–Ω–æ.

##### Curated measurements sets

FreeSewing also provides **curated measurements sets**. These are measurements set from real people that we use to test our platform and designs. But you can also use them to test-drive our platform before you break out the measuring tape.
