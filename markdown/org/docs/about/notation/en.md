pattern notation:

- [Lines](#lines)

<Tip>

##### Might vary slightly between preview and final result

For reasons that are surprisingly complex, there might be slight
differences in fonts and colors between how a pattern looks online
and how it looks as a downloaded PDF or SVG.

</Tip>

## Lines

Lines (and curves) make up the bulk of marking you'll find on any sewing
pattern, including FreeSewing's patterns. 

### Seams

Seams (the lines on which you sew) are indicated by a solid line.
The color of the line indicates the fabric type of the pattern piece:

<Legend part="fabricLines">

Seamlines for different fabric types

</Legend>

### Seam allowance

Seam allowance is indicated by a dashed line, that has the same width and color
as the seam they belong to:

<Legend part="saLines"> Seam allowance for different fabric types </Legend>

Note that the corners of the seam allowance are trimmed, and not extended:

<Legend part="sa"> A trimmed seam allowance corner </Legend>

### Grainline

Grainlines — a line that indicates the _fabric grain_ — look like this:

<Legend part="grainline">

A grainline indicator

</Legend>

### Cut-on-fold indicator

Cut-on-fold indicators look similar to grainline indicators, but point towards the line on which the fabric should be folded:

<Legend part="cutonfold">

A cut-on-fold indicator

</Legend>

### Dimensions

When you opt for a _paperless_ pattern, your pattern will come with dimensions:

<Legend part="dimension">

An example of a dimension on a pattern

</Legend>

### Other lines

Some patterns may have other lines on them, there are 4 additional styles:

- Note
- Mark
- Contrast
- Help

They might be used by patterns designers to add additional info, depending on the context.

<Legend part="otherLines">

Other line styles

</Legend>

## Line widths and strokes

Designers can, if they so choose, override the default line widths or set a specific stroke.
They might do that to add additional info, like where to fold a pattern, or the outline of where a pocket would go.

For reference, here are the different available line widths:

<Legend part="lineWidths">

The different line widths

</Legend>

And these are the different stroke styles:

<Legend part="lineStrokes">

The different line strokes

</Legend>

## Annotations

Annotations are extra embellishments on the pattern that further clarify the
designer's intent, help with construction, or otherwise provide value to the
pattern.

### Notches

There are two types of notches. The default notch is a dot in a circle.

An alternative style shows a cross in a circle.
This style is used to indicate the back of a garment.
For example, on a sleevecap you may see a dot and a cross notch.
This way you know which side of the sleevecap is the back (the one with the cross notch).

<Legend part="notches"> 

The default notch style (shown left) and alternative style for notches on the back

</Legend>

<Tip>

##### Why we chose these notches

In electromagnetism, a ⊙ symbol is used to indicate a flow of current coming towards you (to the front),
whereas ⊗ is used for a current moving away from you (to the back).

You can also think of an arrow. When an arrow flies towards you, you see its tip (⊙).
When an arrow flies away from you, you see its fletches (⊗).

</Tip>

### Buttons and Buttonholes

Buttons and buttonholes may come in different sizes, but always have the same shape that represents
how they look in real life:

<Legend part="buttons">

A button is shown on the left, and a buttonhole on the right

</Legend>

### Bartacks

A bartack is a stitch of varying size and length used to reinforce fabric. It is often used on the edges of seams such as at a pocket or fly opening.

<Legend part="bartack">

This is how a bartack displays on a pattern. 
</Legend>


### Snaps

Snaps have a _stud_ and _socket_ part, and also look like the real thing:

<Legend part="snaps">

A snap stud is shown on the left, and a snap socket on the right

</Legend>

### Titles

Each pattern piece has a title that tells you the number and name of the piece, as well as the pattern name and a timestamp of when the pattern was drafted:

<Legend part="title">

Example of a title

</Legend>

### Logo

Some (or all) pattern pieces may also include the FreeSewing logo.
The logo has no special meaning, it's just branding.

<Legend part="logo">

The FreeSewing logo

</Legend>

### Scale box

The scale box allows you to verify that your pattern was printed to the correct scale:

<Legend part="scalebox">

The scale box

</Legend>
