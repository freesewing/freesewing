Your FreeSewing account is where we store your data. Your account itself can hold the following fields:

<ReadMore recurse />

In addition, any 
[bookmarks](/docs/site/about/site/bookmarks/), 
[measurements sets](/docs/site/about/site/sets/), 
[patterns](/docs/site/about/site/patterns/), and
[API keys](/docs/site/about/site/apikeys/) are strictly speaking also part
of your _account data_ but they are stored as individual records, rather than
as fields in your account.
