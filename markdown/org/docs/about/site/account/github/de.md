If you add your **GitHub username** and **GitHub email address** to your account, we will use them when interacting with GitHub on your behalf.

Note that both your GitHub username and email is public info. This merely allows us to make a link between your FreeSewing account and GitHub account.

For example, when you report a problem on this website, we can mention you so you will receive notifications when there is an update. For this, your username is sufficient.

When you submit a showcase post or make changed to our content, we can credit those commits to you if we have both your username and the email address you use on GitHub.

<Note compact>If all of this in confusing, you don't have to provide this info. It's an advanced feature.</Note>
