If you add your **GitHub username** and **GitHub email address** to your account, we will use them when interacting with GitHub on your behalf.

Note that both your GitHub username and email is public info. This merely allows us to make a link between your FreeSewing account and GitHub account.

For example, when you report a problem on this website, we can mention you so you will receive notifications when there is an update. For this, your username is sufficient.

When you submit a showcase post or make changed to our content, we can credit those commits to you if we have both your username and the email address you use on GitHub.

If all of this in confusing, you don't have to provide this info. It's an advanced feature.
