Every FreeSewing user has a user ID, sometimes referred to as `UID` or just `ID`.
It is a number that uniquely identifies one particular user.

You can find it on [your account page](/account) under **info**.
Or navigate to [/id](/id) and  -- if you are logged in -- you will see your ID there.

<Tip compact noP>
Make sure to always mention your ID when [contacting support](/support).
