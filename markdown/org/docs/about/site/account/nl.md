Your FreeSewing account is where we store your data. Your account itself can hold the following fields:

<ReadMore recurse />

In addition, any [bookmarks](/docs/site/about/site/bookmarks/), [measurements sets](/docs/site/about/site/sets/), [patterns](/docs/site/about/site/patterns/), and [API keys](/docs/site/about/site/apikeys/) are strictly speaking also part of your _account data_ but they are stored as individual records, rather than as fields in your account.
