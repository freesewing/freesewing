Every FreeSewing user has a role that determines their privileges on the site.

You can see your role on [your account page](/account) under **info**.
Or navigate to [/id](/id) and  -- if you are logged in -- you will see your role there.

The following roles exist:

- **user**
- **bughunter**
- **support**
- **admin**

## User

More that 99.99% of FreeSewing users have the **user** role.
It is the default role, and it is exceedingly rare to have a user that has a different role.

## Bughunter

The **bughunter** role grants you permission to read measurments and patterns
data from other users.

It is a role that is reserved for people in the community who want to help
other users troubleshoot their patterns.

## Soporte

The **support** role grants you permission to read all account data from other users.

It is a role reserved for contributors who hunt down bugs reported by users.

## Admin

The **admin** role grants you all permissions, including changing the roles of other users.

Only [joost](/users/user?id=1) holds the admin role.
