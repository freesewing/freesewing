title: "API Keys: Name"
---

Every API key has a **name** attribute that is mandatory.

In other words, you must give each of your API keys a name, but that name can be anything you want.

Typically, people give names that describe where the key is used, like:

- Production backend
- GitLab runner
- Local development on my laptop

But you do you.
