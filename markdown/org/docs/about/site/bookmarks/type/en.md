title: Type
---

Every bookmark has a **type** attribute that is mandatory.

When you manually create a bookmark, the type is always **custom** so you cannot choose it.

Other types include **pattern**, **doc**, or **set** which will automatically be set when you bookmark a pattern, documentation page, or measurements set respectively.
