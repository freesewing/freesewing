title: Ampliación del patrón

This option suppresses all efforts to make the pattern consume less space/paper.

Designers will often take steps to reduce the amount of paper consumed by a pattern.  For example, a strip of fabric used for binding, or a simple rectangular part may not be included, or only partially.

This option -- which is disabled by default -- allows you to suppress the space saving and indicate you rather want to get full-sized views on all pattern parts.
