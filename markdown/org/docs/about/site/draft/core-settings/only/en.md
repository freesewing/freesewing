title: Included Parts
---

This setting allows you to specify which patterns parts you want to generate.

This can be useful if you want to only use a specific part. For example perhaps
you have a shirt pattern and you only want to generate a different collar
style.

It can also be used to include pattern parts that -- for whatever reason -- are
hidden by default.
