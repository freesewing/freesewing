title: Include Seam Allowance
---

This [Core Setting][core-settings] controls whether or not to include seam
allowance on your pattern.

By default, seam allowance is not included. To generate a pattern with seam
allowance, you should enable it by changing this option to **Yes**.

<Note>

FreeSewing's core library only takes a single setting to handle seam allowance: `sa`.
However, for convenience, we've split this up into two different settings on the website:

- **[Include Seam Allowance](/docs/site/draft/core-settings/sabool)**: Controls whether or not to include seam allowance
- **[Seam Allowance Size](/docs/site/draft/core-settings/samm)**: Controls how big to make the seam allowance, if it is included

The latter will only be shown if you've enabled the former.
