title: Units
---

This controls the units used on your pattern. FreeSewing supports both metric
and imperial units.

Note that as a FreeSewing user, you can configure your units in your account,
and those are the units that will be used by default.  However, if you want to
override those settings on an individual basis -- perhaps you are generating a
pattern on behalf of someone else -- this setting allows you to do that.
