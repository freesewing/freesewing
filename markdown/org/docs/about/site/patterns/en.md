(sewing) Patterns is why most people end up on FreeSewing.org, so they are an important part of the website.

FreeSewing does not store the pattern itself, instead we store your settings you used to draft the design, this includes:

- Any design options you tweaked
- Any core settings you changes
- The measurements used

With this, we can regenerate the pattern. So this is all we store. 

This also means that if a pattern goes through significant changes, or a new major version with breaking changes is released, we may no longer be able to generate the (old) pattern. For this reason, you should download the pattern as PDF or SVG and save it locally if you want to archive it.

In addition to the settings required to recreate the pattern, patterns are stored with the following fields:
