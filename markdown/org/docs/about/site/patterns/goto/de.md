title: What to do after saving a new pattern?
---

When you create a new pattern in FreeSewing's pattern editor, you have the option to save the pattern to your account.

After you save the pattern to your account, there are several options for what you might want to do next:

- Continue editing the saved patter
- Display the pattern information page

Because we cannot read your mind, you can choose what you would like to happen when you save a new pattern to your account.
