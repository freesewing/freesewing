title: Name

Every measurements set has a **name** attribute that is mandatory.

In other words, you must give each of your measurements sets a name, but that name can be anything you want.

Typically, people give names that describe the set, like:

- Myself, January 2024
- Tony with binder
- Jenny post augmentation

But you do you.
