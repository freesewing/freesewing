Every measurements set has a **units** attribute that controls what units will be used to display measurements in the set.

While each FreeSewing user has a **units** setting in their account that controls their overall preference between imperial or metric units, it is common to also have measurements sets for different people, and those different people might have other preferences.

Deshalb kannst du die Einheiten bei jedem Messgerät einstellen.
