title: Unidades

Every measurements set has a **units** attribute that controls what units will be used to display measurements in the set.

While each FreeSewing user has a **units** setting in their account that controls their overal preference between imperial or metric units, it is common to also have measurements sets for differnet people, and those different people might have other preferences.

Por eso te permitimos establecer las unidades en cada conjunto de medidas.
