title: Terminology
---

This page includes a glossary of terms that are used on FreeSewing.org.

<Note>
##### The purpose of this glossary

To avoid having to explain what (for example) **edgestitching** means each time
we use it, we maintain a central list of terminology (jargon) with a link to
its documentation.

##### How to use this glossary

We also make it easy for documentation authors to include definitions for
glossary terms they use by merely emphasising the term, like this:
_edgestitching_.

For more details, refer to [our Markdown guide](https://freesewing.dev/guides/markdown/jargon) on [FreeSewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/).
