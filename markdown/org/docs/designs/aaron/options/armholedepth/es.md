title: "Profundidad del orificio"

Esta opci√≥n controla la profundidad del agujero de armadura.

This option applies to the new v3 way of calculating the armhole depth. If you enable the [legacy armhole depth](/docs/designs/brian/options/legacyarmholedepth) option, this option will not apply, but instead it's legacy version [armhole depth factor](/docs/designs/brian/options/armholedepthfactor) will.

In any case, Aaron allows the armhole to drop much further using the [armhole drop](/docs/designs/aaron/options/armholedrop) option. So you probably don't need this option from the underlying block, but it's there if you'd like to tweak it.
