title: Binding width
---

Controls the width of the kniw binding on Aaron.

The default knit binding width is 6 x the seam allowance. For metric users with the default 1cm seam allowance, this results in a 1.5cm wide knit binding which is a good value.

For imperial users (who have a default seam allowance of 0.5") or users who choose to use a larger seam allowance, the value of 6 time the seam allowance will probable result in a knit binding that it too wide, so this option allows you to control that.

<Note>

This option is expressed in percetage of the seam allowance. So the default s600%, or 6 time the seam allowance,.
