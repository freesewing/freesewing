title: "Albert apron: Fabric Options"
- - -

An apron works best with a fabric that is sturdy, tightly woven, and easy to clean. In addition, make sure to go for a natural fibre and in any case something that is heat-resistant.

Heavy cotton, chino, canvas or denim are all excellent choices.

When in doubt, go for raw denim (pure cotton, if it stretches it's no good).
