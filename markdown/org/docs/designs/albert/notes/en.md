title: "Albert apron: Designer Notes"
---

Albert was something that I didn't plan on making. My daughter, who's a visual artist, asked if I could make her an 
apron. Of course, I could not deny her such a request. And since I didn't have a pattern, I needed to make one. 
And that meant that I could just as well make one for FreeSewing while I was at it.

The design is simple, since an apron generally is. And yet, where else than at FreeSewing can you get a
bespoke apron?

This is a very good project for a beginning sewist.
