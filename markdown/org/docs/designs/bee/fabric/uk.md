### Main and Lining Fabric

The main and lining fabric are the same type of material. Bee is made with swimwear fabrics such as lycras.

<Note>

You only need lining fabric if you intend to make the pattern reversible or if you want the band for the cross back tie variant to be a constrasting fabric. Otherwise you can cut all the required pieces from your main fabric.
