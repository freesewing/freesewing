title: "Bee bikini top: What You Need"
---

To make Bee, you will need the following:

- Basis naaimateriaal
- About 0.5 - 1 metre (0.6 - 1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Bee Fabric options](/docs/patterns/bee/fabric/))
- (Optional) About 0.5 - 1 metre (0.6 - 1.1 yards) of lining fabric ([see Bee Fabric options](/docs/patterns/bee/fabric/))
- (Optional) Ribbons/Tapes/Cords for neck ties and bands, with the same length and width as neck tie and/or band.

<Note>

The lining fabric is only needed if you want to make this pattern reversible. If you don't, you only need the main fabric.  
You can use a serger/overlocker to construct this pattern but it is not mandatory.  
Ribbons/Tapes/Cords can be used instead of making custom ties. Just make sure to get more than you need and that you cut down to size after construction.

</Note>
