title: "Bee bikini top: Designer Notes"
---

I made Bee together with Prudencerabbit, as they wanted to make a swimwear pattern that went along with a previous freesewing pattern.
It is based on a garment they made and wanted to make available for other people make as well.
We worked of FreeSewing's body block Bella as a base, converting it to a single dart block to make the top.
During pattern testing one of our contributors TangerineShark made a variant with crossover back ties which we found so cool we added it to Bee!
You can get this variation by using [option Cross Back Ties](/docs/designs/bee/options/crossbackties/).
Bee can also be made reversible by using options [Reversible](/docs/designs/bee/options/reversible), [Duo Colours Ties](/docs/designs/bee/options/duocolorties) & [Neck Tie Colours](/docs/designs/bee/options/necktiecolours).
With the previous pattern being retired you can use [Uma](/docs/designs/uma) to make a matching bikini bottom.
