title: "Bella body block: Cutting Instructions"
---

**Main fabric**

- Cut **1 Front** part on the fold.
- Cut **2 Back** parts.

These cutting instructions are just for the default Bella block. Adjust your cutting accordingly if you have/are making changes to the block.

<Tip>

If you do not have someone to help pin you into Bella then you may find it easier to Cut 2 Front parts with seam allowance and sew the backs up when constructing so you can pin in the front.

</Tip>

<Note>

###### Bella is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.
