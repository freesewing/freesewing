This block was a collaboration between myself and an industry insider who prefers to remain anonymous because of her profession.

It is the parametric version of a base block for womenswear that is used in the industry in Italy to design womenswear.
However, while the block will adapt to your measurments, the original block that it is based on is in really not suitable for a very wide sizing range.

So your milage may very here, especially when you are further from the kind of skinny ladies Italians tend to design for.
