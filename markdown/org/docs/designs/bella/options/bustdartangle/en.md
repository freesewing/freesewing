<!-- ![The effect of the bust dart angle option on the pattern](sample.png) -->

The **bust dart angle** option controls the angle of the bust dart.
It attempts to set the angle of the top leg of the dart at the
requested angle.
However, the angle may be limited to ensure that a minimum
amount of fabric is left above and below the dart.
