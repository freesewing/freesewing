## Anmerkungen und Hinweise

### Präzision

Since a bow tie is a rather small item, precision with sewing is key to a good result. Any slight difference between the upper and lower part of the bow will stand out. Um gute Ergebnisse zu erzielen, fand ich es immer sehr hilfreich, die Nahtlinie auf die Einlage zu übertragen und dieser beim Nähen zu folgen.

### Setze das Bügeleisen weise ein

Later in the construction steps, you will be asked to press your fabric. Sei dabei bitte vorsichtig, damit du deinen womöglich empfindlichen Stoff nicht zu viel Hitze aussetzt.

It's a good idea to try pressing some fabric scraps before you start. Dies erlaubt dir, die richtigen Hitzeeinstellungen für den verwendeten Stoff zu finden.

### Fadenlauf wählen

This pattern includes a grain line. Der Fadenlauf ist hier größtenteils dafür gedacht, um mit der Einlage verwendet zu werden. Da jedes Teil des Schnittmusters mit Einlage versehen wird, ist der Fadenlauf des Oberstoffes nicht so wichtig. Du kannst hier auch vom Standard abweichen, um einen informelleren Eindruck zu erzeugen.

<Note>

If this all sounds very confusing, might I suggest reading the help
page on [Fabric grain](/docs/sewing/fabric-grain).

</Note>

### Bow tie adjustment ribbon and hardware

By default, this design makes a fixed-length bow tie that is the right length for a certain neck size. However, by enabling the Adjustment Ribbon option, it can also make a tie that uses an adjustment ribbon and hardware that makes the bow tie adjustable to different neck sizes. Das ist sehr nützlich, wenn deine Hemden nicht alle dasselbe Halsmaß/Kragenweite haben oder wenn du manchmal gerne Hemden trägst, die etwas mehr Zugabe am Hals haben.

These adjustment ribbons and bow tie hardware can be found in the better haberdasheries or can be ordered online.

<Note>

These instructions are for the type of adjustment ribbon that comes with
holes at regular intervals, to be used in combination with two-piece
hardware consisting of an oval loop part and a part with a smaller loop
and attached T-shaped hook.

There are other styles of bow tie ribbons and hardware, but their use is
outside the scope of these instructions.

</Note>

### Nahtzugabe

Da die Fliege mit den rechten Seiten des Stoffes zueinander konstruiert wird, muss das Ganze am Ende von innen nach außen gedreht werden. Du solltest vielleicht erwägen, eine kleinere Nahtzugabe wie 6mm (¼ inch) zu verwenden, um die Menge an Stoff zu reduzieren.

## Konstruktion

### Schritt 1: Einlage einsetzen

Apply interfacing to all parts where you feel it's needed.

### Ohne Einstellband

#### Step 2: Sew the bow to the collar band

Put one of the Collar Band parts on one of the Bow parts, right sides together. Align the ends of both parts. Now sew across the end to join the parts.

![Sew the collar band to the bow](step12.png)

In a similar fashion, sew a second Bow part to the other end of the same Collar Band.

Repeat these steps to sew the other 2 Bows to the other Collar Band.

Press open all the seams.

You now have two identical single sided bow ties.

#### Schritt 3: Beide Seiten zusammenfügen

![Sew both sides together](step13.png)

Lay both the sides you made on top of each other, right sides together. Sew all along the edges, but leave an area of 5 cm open in the middle of the collar band. Through this opening we will turn the bow tie right side out.

#### Schritt 4: Wenden

![Clip seam allowance](step14.png)

Clip the seam allowance back in the usual spots and make little cuts to allow for a smooth curves.

Then use the back of a large crochet hook, or some other appropriately long skinny object, to turn the two sides right-side-out through the little opening. Start by gently pulling the two fabric pieces at the end of the bow apart. Then push the end of the bow up between the two pieces of fabric. Keep gently pushing while pulling the rest of the tie down over it. This can be a tedious procedure. Take your time and be gentle. It's easy to push too hard and rip stitches or fabric.

Once you have the tie right side out, make sure you push all the corners and sides out before giving it a good press.

#### Schritt 5: Schließen

![Closing the bow tie](step15.png)

Now all that is left is closing the little hole we used to turn the bow tie right side out. You can do this by hand with a slip stitch, or a ladder stitch. Or you can use the machine and stitch right at the edge of the band. Since this will normally be hidden by the collar of your shirt, it will not be all that obvious.

Now give it one last press and admire your work.

### Mit Anpassungsband

#### Schritt 2: Das Band anfügen

![Sew the ribbon to part 1](step22.png)

The first thing to do is to sew the adjustment ribbon to the Short Bow part. The ribbon should be 290mm long. If it is different, you have to make sure that you align it such that the ribbon and short bow piece together are as long as the long bow piece.

Put right sides of the Short Bow piece and the ribbon together.

Now sew across the end to join the parts.

#### Schritt 3: Beide Seiten zusammenfügen

![Sew both sides together](step23.png)

Lay both of the Medium Bow parts on top of each other, right sides together.

Sew all along the edges, but leave the short end open. Through this opening we will turn the bow tie part right side out.

Lay the Long Bow on top of the ribbon and Short Bow part, also right sides together.

Again, sew all along the edges, leaving the short end open.

#### Schritt 4: Wenden

![Clip seam allowance](step14.png)

Clip the seam allowance back in the usual spots and make little cuts to allow for a smooth curves.

Then use the back of a large crochet hook, or some other appropriately long skinny object, to turn the two parts right-side-out through the ends. Start by gently pulling the two fabric pieces at the end of the bow apart. Then push the end of the bow up between the two pieces of fabric. Keep gently pushing while pulling the rest of the tie down over it. This can be a tedious procedure. Take your time and be gentle. It's easy to push too hard and rip stitches or fabric.

Once you have the part right side out, make sure you push all the corners and sides out before giving it a good press.

Do this with both parts.

#### Schritt 5: Zubehör hinzufügen

Now we need to add the two pieces of hardware that make the bow tie adjustable. The oval loop piece will be attached to the part without the adjustment ribbon. And, the piece with the T-hook will go on the part with the ribbon.

First do the part without the ribbon. This is because the fabric tail of the ribbon piece will have to go through the oval part before sewing on its hardware. If you would do it in the other sequence, you may not be able to feed it through.

To finish the ends, we're going to fold the fabric in three steps, before sewing it in a fourth step:

![Three steps to fold, one step to sew](step25.png)

1. First we fold the sides in at an angle.
2. Then we fold the end over by just a small seam allowance, something like 5 mm.
3. Then we fold it over again, for about 1 cm.
4. Finally we stick the oval loop under this last fold and stitch across.

Now feed the adjustment ribbon piece through the oval loop, and attach the T-hook to the end of the ribbon, sewing it in the same way.

Hook the T in one of the adjustment holes and your bow tie is done!
