To make Benjamin, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/patterns/benjamin/fabric/)). Left over
  pieces of a recent project could work too.
- About the same amount of interfacing
- Optionally: Bow tie adjustment ribbon and hardware
