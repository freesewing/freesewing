![Bow ties Wide and Narrow](tipwidth.svg)

You can make BIG bow ties, or small ones. This option allows you to change the vertical size of the bows. Make them larger to be more flamboyant, or small for a more subdued style.

<Note>

###### Not used with the Square bow tie type

This option is ignored with the Square bow tie option. Square bow ties are as wide as the knot width.
