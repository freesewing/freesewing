title: "Bent body Block: Cutting Instructions"
---

**Main fabric**

- Cut **1 Front** part on the fold.
- Cut **1 Back** part on the fold.
- Cut **2 Top sleeve** parts.
- Cut **2 Under sleeve** parts.

These cutting instructions are just for the default Bent block. Adjust your cutting accordingly if you have/are making changes to the block.

<Warning>

As Bent is a block it does not have any closures. If you are making a test Bent you will want to Cut 2 Front parts with seam allowances so you can pin yourself into it.

</Warning>

<Note>

###### Bent is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.
