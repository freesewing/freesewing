title: "Bent body Block: What You Need"
---

To make Bent, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.5 - 2 metres (1.7 - 2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Bent Fabric options](/docs/patterns/bent/fabric/))

This list is for a default Bent Block. If you have/are making changes to the block you may need to get additional items such as closures, binding etc.

<Note>

###### Bent is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.
