title: "Bent body Block: Designer Notes"
---

I Designed Bent because I wanted to make [Jaeger](/designs/jeager) and back then, FreeSewing had no foundation block with a 2-part sleeve that's used in jackets and coats.

So Bent is essentially Brian with a 2-part sleeve -- in other words, it has an undersleeve part and a topsleeve part -- and that's about it.

Since designing Bent, it has become the foundation for all our coat and jacket designs.
