title: "Shoulder slope reduction"
- - -

This pattern adapts to sloped shoulder by taking the shoulder slope measurment into account.

However, for jackets or coats, you may want to create more room at the shoulders to allow for shoulder pads. This option lets you create extra room at the shoulders by reducing the amount the shoulders are sloped.
