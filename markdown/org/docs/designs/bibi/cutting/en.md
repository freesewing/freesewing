- **Main fabric**
  - Cut 1 *Front* on the fold
  - Cut 1 *Back* on the fold
  - Cut 2 *Sleeve(s)* mirrored (if enabled)
- **Ribbing**
  - Cut 1 *Neck Binding*
  - Cut 2 *Armhole Binding(s)* or *Cuff(s)* (depending on selected options)
  - Cut 1 *Waistband* (if enabled)

## Caveats

- There is extra hem allowance at the bottom hem if there is no *Waistband* part.
- There is extra hem allowance at the sleeve part if there is no *Cuff* part.
- There is no seam allowance on the neck opening.
- There is no seam allowance on the armhole if the sleeve is disabled.
- There is no seam allowance on the long sides of the *Armhole Binding* and *Neck Binding* parts.

<Note>
You can cut the front or back parts on the fold, or you can cut the halves separately and sew them together. This is especially
useful if you only have smaller pieces of fabric or if you want to add buttons or zippers to your design. In this case, make sure
to add sufficient seam allowance on the center fold.
