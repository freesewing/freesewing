- Cut 1 back on the fold.
- Cut 1 front on the fold.
- Cut 2 sleeves _with good sides together_ (optional)
  - If you cut sleeves separately, remember that one has to be a mirror image of the other.
  - There is no sleeve part if sleeves are disabled or the sleeve length setting is below 5%

## Caveats

- There is extra hem allowance at the hem.
- Depending on how you want to finish the neck and armholes, choose an appropriate seam allowance.
