Bibi is by default designed as a close-fitting top and is best suited to knit fabrics with some stretch, such as jersey.

If your main fabric is elastic enough, can use strips of it to finish the waistband, armholes/cuffs and neck opening.
Alternatively, you can also use rib fabric or store-bought strips of knit binding.

<Tip>
If you're new to sewing, interlock jersey is nice to work with, as it doesn't roll up. 
Prefer jersey with a few percent spandex for better recovery.
 
Fabric weights can also help you make your choice. 
A weight of 130-200 grams per square meter (or 4-6 ounces per square yard) is likely to be about right for a basic shirt.
</Tip>

<Note>
Woven fabrics with good drape and thicker fabrics such as sweat could also work. 
Increase all ease settings to around 15% and ensure the neck hole is large enough to fit a head through.
Alternatively, you can also attach a zipper or buttons to the front or back to make it easier to put on.
