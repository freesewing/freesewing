Bibi is by default designed as a close-fitting top and is best suited to knit fabrics with some stretch, such as jersey.

Woven fabrics with good drape could also work. Increase ease settings and ensure the neck hole is large enough to fit a head through.

<Tip>
If you're new to sewing, interlock jersey is nice to work with, as it doesn't roll up. Prefer jersey with a few percent spandex for better recovery. Fabric weights can also help you make your choice. A weight of 130-200 grams per square meter (or 4-6 ounces per square yard) is likely to be about right.
