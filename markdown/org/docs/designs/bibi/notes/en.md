When I was designing my (in progress) Tina top, I originally was basing the pattern on 
Teagan and Brian. However, Tina is supposed to work for people with breasts
and Brian is mostly designed for menswear and doesn't support much body
and bust fitting. So I created Bibi as a base for Tina.

For Bibi, I reused code from Brian mostly for the sleevecap and armhole construction 
and added a basic front bust adjustment. Because Bibi is supposed to be usable for very different lengths, 
I also changed the sideline calculation to fit to the waist and seat measurements
and added a sleeveless option. After some fine-tuning, this is basically the result.

While Bibi was specifically made to support people with breasts, 
it also works fine as a base for unisex clothes or t-shirts.

However, it's also important to talk about what Bibi is not:

Bibi can definitely be sewn as a simple top or dress, 
but it's mainly designed as a building block for other patterns or your custom designs.

Bibi is highly customizable, but it does not necessarily represent a specific garment or follow a specific style.
Some option combinations might not make much sense, and you may have to experiment with different options
yourself to find the design you're looking for. 

For example, when you make a dress with Bibi out of woven fabric, you'll have to ensure yourself that there
is enough room for leg movement.
Depending on the shape around the waist or the size of the neck hole,
you also may have to add buttons or zippers on the front or back so you can actually put it on.

Bibi is also not a standard block/sloper for woven fabric. It only does a very basic front bust adjustment 
designed for stretchy knit fabric and will not work well as a base for fitted shirts and blouses from woven fabric.

The name Bibi is a little joke and comes from *Bibi und Tina*, a German audio play for children,
where 13-year-old witch *Bibi Blocksberg* is a companion of *Tina*. So it kinda makes sense.
