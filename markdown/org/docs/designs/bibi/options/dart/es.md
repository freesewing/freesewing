If the *HPS to waist front* measurement is larger than the *HPS to waist back* or when a *full bust adjustment* (FBA) affects the side seam, the front part often has a longer side seam than the back part.

This option determines if a bust dart should be created to match lengths. Otherwise, fabric gathering might be used.

This option has no effect if the side seam length difference isn't large enough to warrant a dart.
