If the pattern should be drafted with a basic full bust adjustment (FBA). 
This will result in a more fitted garment for people with breasts.

If you don't enable this option, Bibi will essentially be drafted
for a body without breasts that has the same chest circumference as
your body with breasts. For people with breasts, this will cause a 
bunch of extra fabric at the chest and armholes that will make the 
top look like a poor fit.

There is usually no need to disable this option. It will have little effect on people
with smaller busts or no breasts.

<Note>
When the optional bust related measurements are not available, no FBA will be performed and this option has no effect.
