title: "Fit the waist"

Enable this option to fit the waist, rather than drafting a straight rectangular shape.

Fitting the waist will yield best results for those with a smaller waist who are looking for a more hourglass-shaped fitted top.

Not fitting the waist will instead create something that looks more like a loose men's t-shirt.
