title: "Fit the waist"

Enable this option to fit the waist of your Teagan, rather than draft a straight T-shirt shape.

This will yield best results for those with a smaller waist who are looking for a more hourglass-shaped fitted T-shirt.

If your waist is larger than your hips, you should not enable this option as you may end up with a T-shirt that you can't get in to.
