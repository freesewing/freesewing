Which measurement to use for the bottom hem.
If the length bonus is zero, the bottom of the garment will be at exactly the selected measurement.

Note that the options *underbust*, *knee* and *floor* require the corresponding optional vertical measurements.
If they are missing, a very rough estimate is used instead.

Use a negative length bonus when selecting *floor* to prevent the garment from actually dragging on the floor.
