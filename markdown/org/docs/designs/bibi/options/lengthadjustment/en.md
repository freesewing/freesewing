Controls how much the front part is made longer to compensate for the curve around the bust. 
Has little effect on smaller busts.

This setting controls the influence of the hps-to-waist-front measurement. At 0% only the hps-to-waist-back measurements
are used to create the waist line. At higher settings, the front part is enlarged to compensate for a larger bust.

This setting has no effect if the hps-to-waist-front measurement is smaller than hps-to-waist-back or equal.
