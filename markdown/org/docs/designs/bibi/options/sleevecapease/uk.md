Determines the amount of sleevecap ease.

<Note>

The amount of sleevecap ease determines how the sleeves rolls from the shoulder.
More ease makes the sleeve curl into the seam as you see on suit jackets. Less ease makes the sleeve lie flat.

For light fabric or knits, you want little to no sleevecap ease. For heavier woven fabrics, you need more sleevecap ease.
