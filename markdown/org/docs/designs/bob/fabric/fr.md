title: "Bob the Bib: Fabric Options"

An bib should be soft, absorbent, and be able to handle plenty of washing cycles. In addition, natural fibres are much preferred, especially for babies.

So use cotton, flannel, or jersey knit for the bib front of the bib, and back it with something like terrycloth (aka towel fabric) or a similar bamboo-based fabric.
