title: "Bob the Bib: Designer Notes"
---

The only reason I designed this pattern is because I wanted something very
simple to use in our [pattern design
tutorial](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/pattern-design).

In fact, I considered this design too simple to include on FreeSewing.org and
for many years it was not available.
But then users started asking *why* it was not available, and I didn't really
have a good answer for that. 

So here it is. A fully parametric bib named Bob.
