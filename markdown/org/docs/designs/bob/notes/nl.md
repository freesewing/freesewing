title: "Bob de Slab: Opmerkingen van de ontwerper"

The only reason I designed this pattern is because I wanted something very simple to use in our [pattern design tutorial](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/pattern-design).

In fact, I considered this design too simple to include on FreeSewing.org and for many years it was not available. But then users started asking *why* it was not available, and I didn't really have a good answer for that.

Dus hier is het. Een volledig parametrische slab genaamd Bob.
