title: Head size

Controls the size of the bib, as it will be drafted to fit this head circumference.

In our tutorial (this bib is what we use in our tutorial to show people the ropes
of designing their own patterns) we use a measurement for this.

But we feel that's a bit overkill for real-world use on our site, so we've made it an option.
