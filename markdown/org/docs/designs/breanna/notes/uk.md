title: "Breanna body block: Designer Notes"
---

With Breanna, I wanted to do two things:

- Create a basic block like [Brian](/designs/brian) but for womenswear
- Try to see in how many different ways I could support the bust dart

It hasn't been a complete success. While some people get good results, others do not.

I leave it up because it's know to work for some. You can check [this FAQ on womenswear blocks for more background info](/docs/faq/womenswear-blocks) about the situation with regards to womenswear blocks.
