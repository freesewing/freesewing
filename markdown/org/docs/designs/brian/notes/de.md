title: "Brian Body Block: Designer-Notizen"
---

Brian ist der FreeSewing-Grundbaustein f체r Herrenmode. Sie ist die Grundlage f체r viele unserer Entw체rfe und das schon seit vielen Jahren.

It is inspired by the teachings of Gareth Kershaw, but has a number of improvements such as handling shoulder slope, the ability to shift the shoulder seam backward and foward on both collar and shoulder side, as well as a highly configureable sleevecap.

Perhaps just as important as what it does, is what it does not do: It does not fit the body. Es geht direkt von der Brust abw채rts. No fitting of the waist whatsoever.

This is intentional to make it easier to extend this design in a variety of styles.
