title: "Brian Body Block: Designer-Notizen"
---

Brian ist der FreeSewing-Grundbaustein für Herrenmode. Sie ist die Grundlage für viele unserer Entwürfe und das schon seit vielen Jahren.

It is inspired by the teachings of Gareth Kershaw, but has a number of improvements such as handling shoulder slope, the ability to shift the shoulder seam backward and forward on both collar and shoulder side, as well as a highly configurable sleevecap.

Perhaps just as important as what it does, is what it does not do: It does not fit the body. Es geht direkt von der Brust abwärts. No fitting of the waist whatsoever.

This is intentional to make it easier to extend this design in a variety of styles.
