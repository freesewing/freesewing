title: "Bloque de cuerpo Brian: Notas del dise침ador"
---

Brian es el bloque de cuerpo b치sico de FreeSewing para ropa de hombre. Es la base de muchos de nuestros dise침os y lo ha sido durante muchos a침os.

It is inspired by the teachings of Gareth Kershaw, but has a number of improvements such as handling shoulder slope, the ability to shift the shoulder seam backward and foward on both collar and shoulder side, as well as a highly configureable sleevecap.

Perhaps just as important as what it does, is what it does not do: It does not fit the body. Se baja directamente desde el pecho. No fitting of the waist whatsoever.

This is intentional to make it easier to extend this design in a variety of styles.
