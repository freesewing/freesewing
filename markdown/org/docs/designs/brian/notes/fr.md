title: "Bloc de corps Brian : Notes du concepteur"
---

Brian est le bloc corporel fondateur de FreeSewing pour les vêtements masculins. Il est à la base de beaucoup de nos conceptions, et ce depuis de nombreuses années.

It is inspired by the teachings of Gareth Kershaw, but has a number of improvements such as handling shoulder slope, the ability to shift the shoulder seam backward and foward on both collar and shoulder side, as well as a highly configureable sleevecap.

Perhaps just as important as what it does, is what it does not do: It does not fit the body. Elle descend tout droit de la poitrine. No fitting of the waist whatsoever.

This is intentional to make it easier to extend this design in a variety of styles.
