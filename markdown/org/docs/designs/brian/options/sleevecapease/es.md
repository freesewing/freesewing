title: "Sleevecap ease"
---

***

This option determines the amount of ease at the sleevecap.

<Note>

The amount of sleevecap ease determines how the sleeves rolls from the shouder.
More ease makes the sleeve curl into the seam as you see on suit jackets. Less ease makes the sleeve lie flat.

For light fabric or knits, you want little to no sleevecap ease. For heavier woven fabrics, you need more sleevecap ease.
