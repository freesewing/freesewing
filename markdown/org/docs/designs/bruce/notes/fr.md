title: "Bruce boxer briefs: Designer Notes"

I originally designed Bruce many years ago, and it's gone through a couple of iterations since. Most notably, Bruce can now be adapted to not have any bulge, making it a fully gender-neutral design and a popular choice for people who want a express a more masculine look without sacrificing fit.

I have not worn any other underwear than Bruce for at least a decade. Suffice to say Bruce comes highly recommended.
