title: "Carlita coat: Designer Notes"
---

Carlita is [Carlton](/designs/carlton) with a full bust adjustment worked into a princess seam.
It is, in other words, Carlton for people who have breasts, or at least are looking for a more female-presenting cut.

Apart from that, it's pretty much the same, with the exception of the chest
pocket which for Carlita is worked into the princess seam.

Just like with Carlton, I can't claim all credit for myself as this design was
a collaboration with [my friend Anneke
Caramin](https://www.instagram.com/annekecaramin/).
