Controls how sharply the princess seam will correct once it's passed the fullness of your breasts.

A high factor will smooth the curve, resulting in a less fitted coat that's easier to sew. A low factor will sharpen the curve, resulting in a more fitted coat, with a princess seam that's harder to sew.
