title: "Carlton Mantel: Designer Notes"
---

Carlon is the reverse-engineered version of the coat worn by Benedict Cumberbatch in [the Sherlock TV-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)).

It was painstakingly puzzled together by myself and [my friend Anneke Caramin](https://www.instagram.com/annekecaramin/) from screengrabs, and pictures we found on the internet.

From the outset, we wanted to make a version for ladies too, which is what [Carlita](/designs/carlita) is.

If you want to cosplay Sherlock Holmes, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better design. Und wenn du, wie ich, einfach nur einen warmen Mantel willst, ist er auch dafür geeignet.
