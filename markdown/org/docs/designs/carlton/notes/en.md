title: "Carlton coat: Designer Notes"

Carlon is the reverse-engineerd version of the coat worn by benedict
cumberbatch in [the Sherlock
TV-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)).

It was painstakingly puzzled together by myself and [my friend Anneke
Caramin](https://www.instagram.com/annekecaramin/) from screengrabs, and
pictures we found on the internet.

From the outset, we wanted to make a version for ladies too, which is what
[Carlita](/designs/carlita) is.

If you want to cosplay Sherlock Holmes, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better
design.
And if, like me, you just want a warm coat, it's great for that too.
