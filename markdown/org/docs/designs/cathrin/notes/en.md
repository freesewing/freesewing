title: "Cathrin corset: Designer Notes"
---

Cathrin is a side-effect of a project that never went anywhere.

I was going to make an elaborate dress, and I needed a corset to wear under it.
So I did some research online, and I found [this tutorial by Cathrin
Åhlén](https://katafalk.wordpress.com/2010/06/24/underbust-pattern-tutorial/)
on drafting an underbust corset.

So, I essentially implemented those instructions in code, and the rest is
history as the original project got abaondoned.

This design is named `cathrin` after Cathrin Åhlén who taught me (and others)
how to draft such a thing.
