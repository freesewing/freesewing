title: "Charlie chinos: Fabric Options"
- - -

The obvious choice for Charlie chinos, is [chino fabric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino_cloth), which is a cotton twill fabric. These days it's often sold as a blend to a little bit of stretch, which is optional.

But you have a lot of options here, and your choice of fabric will influence what sort of style these project.

Go for **wool** for the most classic look. Check the suiting section of your fabric store for options. If this is your first pair, some wool-poly blend is most likely going to be more budget-friendly. But don't let price alone guide you, buying some cheap whimsical fabric is the best way to come up with a shitty looking pair of trousers, and get frustrated in the process.

For **cotton**, go for a heavier weight. Cotton might also be a bit easier on the beginner than wool. If unsure what to use, ask for chino in the fabric store and simply pick a colour you like.

Nothing beats **linen** on a hot summer day. It's fun to work with too, but it does wrinkle like a mofo, and even the most neatly made trousers look somewhat messy when made in linen. What I'm saying is, maybe not for your first pair.
