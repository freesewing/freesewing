title: "Charlie chinos: Designer Notes"
---

I don't think I have ever had a design where I knew what I was going to name
it long before sitting down to actually create it.
Charlie Chinos was just too good to not make happen.

It took a while because it took a long time before [Titan](/designs/titan) was in a state where I was happy with it.
Trousers are hard. Trouser blocks double so.

This is for the most part a rather straight-forward chino pattern, but it has
one twist: The front packets are placed on the side seam. That side seam wraps
around towards the front to give the slanted pocket look.

It's a bit of unusual and creative design that I guess I did because I can?
Anyway, it's something to be mind ful of because if you do not expect it the
front panels look a bit weird.
