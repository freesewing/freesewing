title: "Pantalones chinos Charlie: Notas del diseñador"
---

I don't think I have ever had a design where I knew what I was going to name it long before sitting down to actually create it. Charlie Chinos era demasiado bueno para no hacerlo realidad.

Tardé un tiempo porque [Titan](/designs/titan) tardó mucho tiempo en estar en un estado en el que yo estuviera contenta con ella. Los pantalones son duros. El pantalón bloquea el doble así.

This is for the most part a rather straight-forward chino pattern, but it has one twist: The front packets are placed on the side seam. That side seam wraps around towards the front to give the slanted pocket look.

It's a bit of unusual and creative design that I guess I did because I can? Anyway, it's something to be mind ful of because if you do not expect it the front panels look a bit weird. Anyway, it's something to be mind ful of because if you do not expect it the front panels look a bit weird.
