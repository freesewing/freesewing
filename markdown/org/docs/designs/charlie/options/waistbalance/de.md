title: "Waist balance"
---

Controls the distribution of fabric between front and back parts at the waist.

It is somewhat in vogue to draft a larger back panel these days. Doing so shifts the side seam forward which gives the illusion of being slimmer.

The side effect of shifting the side seam forward is that it's easy to get into the pockets that are located on the side seam.

This option allows you to control this balance.
