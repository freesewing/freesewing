title: "Cornelius cycling breeches: What You Need"
---

To make Cornelius, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 2 metres (2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Cornelius Fabric options](/docs/designs/cornelius/fabric/))
- About 0.5 metres (0.6 yards) of lining fabric ([see Cornelius Fabric options](/docs/designs/cornelius/fabric/))
- Interfacing for the waistband ([see Cornelius Fabric options](/docs/designs/cornelius/fabric/))
- A zip or 3 buttons for the fly
- 3 or 7 Buttons for waistband and leg bands

<Note>

The number of buttons you need are dependent on the cuff style you are using. **Keystone** requires 7 in total whereas **Traditional** and **Elegant** require 3 in total. You may also want to use smaller buttons for the leg bands compared to the waistband but this is up to you.
