title: "Cuff style"

***

This pattern supports three different cuff styles:

- **Traditional**: A single buttoned _curved_ band with a pointed edge.
- **Elegant**: A single buttoned _straight_ band with a pointed edge.
- **Keystone**: A slightly curved band that is wider than the others using 3 buttons rather than 1. This one is based of off the one in the Keystone Draft this pattern is based on.
