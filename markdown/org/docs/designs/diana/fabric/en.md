title: "Diana draped top: Fabric Options"
---

This top works best in one of these two scenarios:

- Use a stretch fabric, and choose minimal ease
- Or use a non-stretch fabric with good _drape_, in which case you'll want to add more ease. Flowy fabrics can be cut on the bias for a body-hugging effect
