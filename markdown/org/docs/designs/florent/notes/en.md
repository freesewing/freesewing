title: "Florent flat cap: Designer Notes"
---

I found a scan of a hand drawn flat cap pattern, for one size and experimented
with scaling on the screen of my laptop and tracing it through with tracing
paper stuck on the screen. 

The goal was to make it fit my (rather big) head circumference. I also made a
few caps, improving the shapes with each prototypes. But then someone asked me
to make one for them... meaning I would need to scale my parts to fit their
head circumference. 

At that time I heard about freesewing and as I am a bit of a geek I gave it a
try to draw my (then improved) pattern pieces. Sure enough I was able to play
with it and get it to scale the parts, to fit any head circumference. I believe
since then a few improvements have been added by other members of the community
and it is always a pleasure to see theses caps popping up on the freesewing
website or on Instagram.
