I found a scan of a hand drawn flat cap pattern, for one size and experimented with scaling on the screen of my laptop and tracing it through with tracing paper stuck on the screen.

Het doel was om het passend te maken voor mijn (nogal grote) hoofdomtrek. I also made a few caps, improving the shapes with each prototypes. But then someone asked me to make one for them... meaning I would need to scale my parts to fit their head circumference.

At that time I heard about freesewing and as I am a bit of a geek I gave it a try to draw my (then improved) pattern pieces. Sure enough I was able to play with it and get it to scale the parts, to fit any head circumference. I believe since then a few improvements have been added by other members of the community and it is always a pleasure to see theses caps popping up on the freesewing website or on Instagram.
