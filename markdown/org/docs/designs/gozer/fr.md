title: Gozer le fantôme
---

Not quite sure what to say about this. It was three weeks or so before Halloween, and I was working on a different pattern. Then the thought of a traditional ghost costume popped into my head.

So as a joke I made this, just so I could post it on the discord server. And then Joost asked where the pattern was. So I posted it. And he published it.
