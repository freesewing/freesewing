## Teeth

This plush toy is intended to have two different coloured fabrics, one for the upper body, and one for the belly. If you don't wish to purchase additional fabric just for the mouth, it's a small enough piece that you can likely use a scrap from the upper body or belly fabric.

Most plush toys have some sort of a faux fur fabric. Lightweight or drapey fabrics may not hold Hi's shape well when stuffed. Fabrics with a two-way stretch work better than wovens. The stretch should be perpendicular to the grainline.

## Teeth Fabric

The teeth have untreated ends, so should be made from a fabric that does not unravel.

## Stuffing

Since this is a pluch toy, it wil need to be stuffed with material. Most of the time you'll want to use polyester fiberfill (polyfill), but if you have a lot of fabric scraps, you can use shredded scrap fabric. However this may be heavier and less soft than fiberfill. It's also worth thinking about whether your Hi may be at risk of getting dirty, or want to go for a swim, as not all stuffing options are washable.
