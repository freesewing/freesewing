title: "Hi the shark: What You Need"
---

To make Hi, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meters of a suitable fabric in color 1 (body)
- About 0.5 meters of a suitable fabric in color 2 (belly)
- Small piece for the mouth
- Small piece of fabric for eyes
- Suitable, unraveling, fabric for the teeth
- Stuffing
- Topstiching thread (thick thread) for gills

<Note>

This list is based on a default Hi and you may need less or more fabric dependant on the [size you are making Hi](/docs/patterns/hi/options/size/).

For instance a 500% Hi will need 5 meters (1 meter x 500%  = 5 meters) and a 50% Hi will need 0.5 meters (1 meter x 50% = 0.5 meters).
