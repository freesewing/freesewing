To make Holmes, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 metres (0.6 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Holmes Fabric options](/docs/patterns/holmes/fabric/))
- About 0.5 metres (0.6 yards) of lining fabric ([see Holmes Fabric options](/docs/patterns/holmes/fabric/))
- A rigid material for the visor insert ([see Holmes Fabric options](/docs/patterns/holmes/fabric/))
- (Optional) About 1 metre of 1" (2.5cm) crossgrain ribbon or petersham.
- (Optional) 1 covered button about 3/4" (2cm) - 7/8" (2.2cm)

<Note>

Depending on style the ties and buttons are optional.

- If you are making Buttonhole Ear Flaps you can omit the ties.
- If you are making Tie Ear Flaps you can omit the button.
- Ties can also be made from fabric if you prefer ([see Holmes Cutting](/docs/patterns/holmes/cutting/))
- You can also use different width and type ribbons for the ties if you prefer.
