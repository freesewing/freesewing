- A rigid material for the visor insert ([see Holmes Fabric options](/docs/designs/holmes/fabric/))
- (Optional) About 1 metre of 1" (2.5cm) crossgrain ribbon or petersham.
- (Optional) 1 covered button about 3/4" (2cm) - 7/8" (2.2cm)

<Note>

Depending on style the ties and buttons are optional.

- If you are making Buttonhole Ear Flaps you can omit the ties.
- If you are making Tie Ear Flaps you can omit the button.
- Ties can also be made from fabric if you prefer ([see Holmes Cutting](/docs/designs/holmes/cutting/))
