The idea of Holmes hat came from [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H24VBFMZJF4) I was watching once, in which Bernadette Banner is making a Sherlock Holmes deerstalker hat, and struggles to find the right shape of the gores to form the dome shape, which ends up doing by trial and error.

As a physicist, I cannot justify solving a problem with an iterative process when there's an analytical solution, so I just calculated the shape needed, and implemented it in a Freesewing pattern, creating a plugin to calculate gore shapes.

The name was an easy choice, I just needed a name starting with H for a Sherlock Holmes hat :)
