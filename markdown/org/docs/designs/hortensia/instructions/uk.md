### (Optional) Step 1: Face the main fabric

- If needed, Interface your main fabric pieces.

### Step 2: Sew the front and back panels to the bottom

- With _good sides together_ sew the front and back panels to the bottom panel.
- Press the seam allowances towards the bottom panel.
- On the outside _Edgestitch_ the seam allowance to the bottom panel.

### Step 3: Create and attach straps

- If needed, face your straps.
- Fold the straps in half lengthwise with _good sides matching_.
- Sew the raw edges together making sure to leave a gap for turning.
- Turn inside out.
- _Slipstich_ the opening closed.
- Alternatively _Edgestitch_ all the edges.
- Attach one strap to the front panel and one strap to the back panel by sewing a rectangle and a cross.

<Warning>

The placement of the straps are not on the pattern and need to be determined. You may need to baste the zipper panel to the front and back panels to help figure out the placement.

</Warning>

<Note>

If using bag strap webbing instead of fabric made straps do the following,

- Cut the webbing to the the length of the straps with seam allowance.
- Press under the short edge seam allowance.
- Attach the webbing the same way as the fabric straps.

</Note>

### Step 4: The zipper

- Insert the zipper into the zipper panel making sure that the zipper pull is on the _good side_.

### (Optional) Step 5: Construct tabs.

- Construct tabs the same as the straps just shorter.
- _Baste_ the tabs _good sides together_ to the short edges of the zipper panel so the tabs face inward.

<Tip>

We recommend the tabs to be about a quarter length of the straps.

</Tip>

### Step 6: Attach the zipper panel

- With _good sides together_ sew the zipper panel to the front and pack panels. We will now refer to this as **the tube**.

### Step 7: Prep the side panels

- Press under the top seam allowance of the side panel reinforcement parts.
- Place the side panel reinforcement parts on top of the side panels matching the raw edges.
- _Edgestitch_ the folded edge of the reinforcement parts to the side panels.
- _Baste_ the raw edges together.

### Step 8: Attach the side panels to the tube

- With _good sides together_ sew the side panels to the tube matching notches to the bottom and zipper panel seams.
- If binding the edges rather than turning, sew with _wrong sides together_ instead.
- If not binding the edges leave a gap in one of the sides for turning.
- Turn inside out and _Slipstich_ the opening closed.
- If sewn _wrong sides together_ bind the raw edges of the side panels.

<Note>

It is recommended to leave the gap for turning on the side rather than the top or bottom as it needs less reinforcement.

</Note>

### Step 9: Lining

- With _good sides together_ sew the front and back lining panels to the bottom lining panel.
- With _good sides together_ attach the lining side panels.
- Press under the top seam allowances.
- Alernatively you can bind the top edges.
- Place the lining inside the bag _wrong sides facing_ eachother.
- _Slipstitch_ or _Whipstitch_ the lining to the zipper panel.

### Step 10: Enjoy!

That's it! You are all done! Now go enjoy you new bag!
