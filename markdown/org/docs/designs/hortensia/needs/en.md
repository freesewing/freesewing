title: "Hortensia handbag: What You Need"
---

To make Hortensia, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 - 2 metres (0.6 - 2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Hortensia Fabric options](/docs/designs/hortensia/fabric/))
- About 0.5 - 2 metres (0.6 - 2.2 yards) of lining fabric ([see Hortensia Fabric options](/docs/designs/hortensia/fabric/))
- A zipper the length of the zipper panels and matching the [coil width](/docs/designs/hortensia/options/zippersize/) selected
- (Optional) About 1 - 2 metres (1.1 - 2.2 yards) of bias binding if you want to bind the side panel edges on the outside.
- (Optional) Bag strap webbing double the length of the strap part with seam allowance and similar width if you don't wish to make your own straps
- (Optional) Interfacing if needed to strengthen fabric and/or for the strap

<Note>

The amount of fabric you need is dependant on [Hortensia's size option](/docs/designs/hortensia/options/size/). If you are uncertain of how much you need turn on paperless mode whilst viewing the pattern and add the bottom measures of Part 1 SidePanel, Part 2 FrontBackPanel and Part 3 BottomPanel to give yourself a rough estimate.
