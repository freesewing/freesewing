title: "Hortensia handtas"
---

Hortensia is designed by @stoffsuchti. She wanted the pattern to be available to people on FreeSewing, and had made the paper designs. She did not have any coding experience, and I volunteerd my time.

The design is well thought out, and based on the Golden Rule. It can be sized up and down to fit your exact needs. Construction is a bit finicky, having quite some curved seams. It can be lined, or you can finish the seams with a bias tape.
