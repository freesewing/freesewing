title: "Size"
- - -

Controls the overall size of the handbag.

Rather than using measurements, Hortensia's size is determined by scaling fixed values.

- 20% : Will scale these values by 0.2
- 200% : Will scale these values by 2

The two fixed values that are used the most are Width: 23cm and Height: 33cm.

<Note>

So an example of this would be the default, which is 50%. This would scale the values by 0.5 resulting in a handbag that is 11.5cm (23cm x 0.5) in width and 16.5cm (33cm x 0.5) in height.

<Tip>

Turn on paperless to see the measurements of the handbag. This will help you to determine the size you want and see the effects of this option.
