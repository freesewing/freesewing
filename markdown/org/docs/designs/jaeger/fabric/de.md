Sportscoats are typically made from a heavier wool, often with some texture or pattern in the weave. In general, they are made in _busier_ fabrics.

Style purists will argue that sportscoats should never be made out of suiting fabric, as a sportscoat is not a suit jacket. You can tell them go feck off and do whatever you want, it's your jacket.

However, making Jaeger is going to take some time. Do yourself a favour and get something nice for the final project. (because you will be making a muslin, right?)
