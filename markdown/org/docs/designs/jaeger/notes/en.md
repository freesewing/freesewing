title: "Jaeger jacket: Designer Notes"
---

I guess that when you start designing sewing patterns as a man, sooner or later
you are going to want to design a jacket.

However, that's not why I did it. I got involved in this because I promised
[Portia Lawrie](https://www.instagram.com/portialawrie/) that I would help her
out with her Refashioners initiative and long story short, [I ended up making a
zebra jacket](/blog/the-refashioners-2017/) for which I obviously needed a
pattern.


So here it is.
