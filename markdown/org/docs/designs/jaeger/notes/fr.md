I guess that when you start designing sewing patterns as a man, sooner or later you are going to want to design a jacket.

Cependant, ce n'est pas pour cela que je l'ai fait. I got involved in this because I promised [Portia Lawrie](https://www.instagram.com/portialawrie/) that I would help her out with her Refashioners initiative and long story short, [I ended up making a zebra jacket](blog/the-refashioners-2017/) for which I obviously needed a pattern.


Alors voici ce qu'il en est.
