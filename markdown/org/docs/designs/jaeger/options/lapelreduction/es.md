How much the tip of the lapels turns inwards.

It is common to have the edge of the lapels not be entirely straight, but rather turn inwards a bit towards the top of the lapels. This option controls by how much it does that.

- Increase this option to shift the lapel tip inward
- Decrease this option to shift the lapel tip outward
