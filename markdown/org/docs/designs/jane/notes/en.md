title: "Jane 1790's Shift: Designer Notes"
---

I made Jane because shifts are a very fundamental part of historical sewing but its hard to make or find a pattern that works for you. A lot of blogs have instructions for drafting, but drafting can be overwhelming. Freesewing allowed me to code a pattern that is sized to your body without you having to do all the work of drafting. The shift Jane is based on is one I made following [Sharon Ann Burnstons instructions](http://sharonburnston.com/). Her work got me interested in shifts and the details and minutia of making one that does what you want it to do. I wanted to make Jane to give people a great place to start their historical sewing journey, a pattern that is easy to use and lets you move on to the exciting things if you feel that way or play around in the world of squarecut garments like I have. -Zee
