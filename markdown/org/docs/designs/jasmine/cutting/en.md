title: "Jasmine Dog Jacket: Cutting Instructions"
---

Cut out one body piece on the fold for a single-layer jacket, or two pieces for a double-layer jacket. 

If you're planning to sew and turn two layers, cut the body with the seam allowance included. If you're planning to finish it with bias tape or leave a single layer with raw edges, seam allowance isn't necessary.

For a hoodie pocket, cut out 1 piece on the fold with a seam allowance.

For a cargo pocket, cut out 2 pocket bag pieces (on the fold) and 2 pocket flap pieces with seam allowance.
