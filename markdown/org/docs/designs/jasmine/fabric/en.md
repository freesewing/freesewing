title: "Jasmine Dog Jacket: Fabric Options"
---

Pick something warm and sturdy enough to hold up to being on your dog. Depending on your dog's
propensity for mess, it might be a good idea to pick something easily washable and dark
enough not to show stains. No stretch is necessary, but it won't hurt.

The simplest fabric choice here is fleece. It's warm, it doesn't unravel at the edges, it's generally
sturdy enough. For a raincoat, you might want something waterproof.
