### Single piece

If you've cut your body piece out of a single layer of a non-unraveling fabric like knit or fleece, 
you're done! No finishing of the edges is necessary. Move onto closures, but you can follow the bias 
tape instructions anyway if you like. 

### Stitch and turn

If you've cut two layers with seam allowance, lay them on top of each other with right sides facing. 

Sew most of the way around, leaving a gap at the back about 50% wider than your palm to turn 
the coat out through. 

If you've picked a fabric with some stretch, use a zigzag stitch or a whip stitch. For no stretch, 
use a straight stitch or backstitch. Back tack or tie off the edges of the gap at the back.

Trim the seam allowance and clip the curves, and turn the coat back out through the opening you left.

Tuck the seam allowance in between the layers at the back opening, and slip stitch the opening closed 
by hand.

You can press the edges flat now if you like, or even edgestitch around the whole jacket to keep the 
edges flatter and neater.

And you're done. Move on to closures.

### Bias Tape

If you're merging two layers with bias tape, put them together with the wrong sides facing (right sides 
out!) and baste along the edges to keep them in place while you apply the tape.

Apply bias tape around the edges, stitch it in place, and you're done.

## Closures 

### Velcro (aka hook and loop fasteners)

Pick which side of the neck opening you would like to be on top when the jacket is closed.
Apply one side of your velcro to the bottom of this end, and the other side to 
the top of the other end.

Repeat the same process with the closures at the belly.

Rectangles are drawn out on the pattern to indicate the placement, but it's fine if your 
velcro is a little thinner. You can cut it to size or leave it be.
