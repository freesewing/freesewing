title: "Jasmine Dog Jacket: What you need"
---

To make Jasmine, you will need:

- A single piece of fabric big enough to cut out the coat piece on the fold
- Something for the closure on the front and belly
  -- Hook-and-loop closures (aka velcro) are good for this, but you can try snaps or buttons
  if you feel bold or they're what you have on hand
- Optional: Enough bias tape to go around the edges
- Optional: A bit of extra fabric for the back pocket,
  in either a matching or contrasting color
