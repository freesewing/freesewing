Lily is designed for stretch fabrics. 2-way stretch can be used as long as the stretch is perpendicular to the grainline. 4-way stretch can also be used.
It is important to remember that **not** all stretch fabrics have the same amount of stretch. You may have to adjust the ease and fabric stretch options to match the stretch of you fabric.

The type of fabric you want depends on use desired. If you are making an Athletic Lily you may wish to use fabrics such as **Spandex**. If you are making a Lily for warmth you may wish to use **Winter knit** fabric just bear in mind these may have less stretch than the default settings for Lily.
