<Note>

This is a garment made from a stretch fabric. So use appropriate seam solutions. A serger is a good way to do this, as 
are specific stitches that certain sewing machine provide. A zigzag stitch will do if that's all you have.

Keep in mind that since these seams are always under tension, it may be a good idea to double them up, or 
provide a zigzag in addition to serging the seam.

### Step 1: Construct the legs

- With *good sides together* sew the crotch seam of the fronts together.
- With *good sides together* sew the cross seam of the backs together.
- With *good sides together* sew the front to the back along the inseam.
- With *good sides together* sew the front to the back along the side seams.

<Tip>

Open the legs out after sewing the crotch and cross seams to make it easy to sew the inseam and side seams.
