title: "Lucy tie-on pocket: What You Need"
---

To make Lucy, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/patterns/lucy/fabric))
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of fabric if using a lining
- About 2 meters (2.2 yards) of bias binding or strips of fabric if binding the edges
- A length of tape that you can tie around your waist to make the ties with

<Note>

#### Piecing is Period!

Pockets like these do not need to be made out of whole pieces of fabric, you can piece together scraps into a large enough piece to cut your pocket pattern out of. Neither do both sides need to be made out of the same fabric.
