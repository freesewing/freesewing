title: "Lucy tie-on pocket: Designer Notes"

This is a 18th century pocket pattern based on the hanging pocket in Patterns of Fashion 1 pp. 73. I made it so people could have a historical pocket pattern that is easily adjustable. I would like historical patterns and resources to be more accessible to people so the documentation has some historical context and suggestions on historically accurate ways to make it, but its just as awesome to see people make wild modern versions.
