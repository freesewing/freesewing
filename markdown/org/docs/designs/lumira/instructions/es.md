<Note>

This is a garment made from a stretch fabric. So use appropriate seam solutions. A serger is a good way to do this, as
are specific stitches that certain sewing machine provide. A zigzag stitch will do if that's all you have.

Keep in mind that since these seams are always under tension, it may be a good idea to double them up, or
provide a zigzag in addition to serging the seam.

</Note>

### Paso 1: Los bolsillos delanteros

- Sew the two pieces to eachother, right sides together, along the top seam.
- Presiona para abrir la bragueta y la costura.
- Con los lados derechos juntos, cose las piezas traseras a lo largo de la costura trasera. This creates a loop.

<Note>
If you want to include elastic into the waistband, now is a good time to do so. You should
add it to the seam you just sewed.
</Note>

### Paso 2: La mosca

- Sew each leg along the long seam to itself. This will result in two 'pipes' of your fabric.

### Step 3: Combine

- Deshaz el hilván de la costura delantera. This seam is marked with '+'.

### Paso 4: Bandas para las piernas

- If you have a front bulge in your gusset, sew the middle 'dart' closed first.
- If you do not have a front bulge, it is useful to sew the front seam closed. This seam is marked with '-'.

### Paso 5: Cintura

<Note>
If you do not have the large back gusset option, you just need to sew the little diamond shaped gusset
in the right spot.
</Note>

- Match all the notches of the gusset with the legs and seams. Be careful, since you'll be sewing a circle
  to an outline, and that is always tricky to get right. Use a lot of pins, or clips, to keep the fabrics
  aligned.
- Sew the seam from one side all the way to the other.

### Paso 6: Botones

- Plancha el margen de costura inferior hacia el revés de la pieza restante de la cintura.
- Plancha la cintura y el margen de costura hacia arriba y lejos de la pierna. Asegúrate de dejar un hueco debajo de las muescas en la parte inferior de las costuras laterales. This seam will combine three layers, both layers of the waistband, and one layer of the leg
  pieces.

### Paso 7: ¡Disfrútalo!

Now you can add the elastic to the leg openings. Otherwise finish those in any way you like.

Todo listo! Enjoy your Lumina leggings!
