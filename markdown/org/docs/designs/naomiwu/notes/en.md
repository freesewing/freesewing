title: "Naomi Wu Cargo Skirt: Designer Notes"
---

As these are the *designer notes* I first want to clear up any 
misunderstanding: I am not the designer of this skirt. Naomi Wu is.
I merely wrote the code to implement this as a FreeSewing design, and worked 
with Naomi to ensure that said code represents her vision for the design.

I've collaborated with others before to bring a design to fruition, but that
was typically with friends or people from the FreeSewing community, and my role
in that collaboration was always much bigger.  This was my first time
working with a bona-fide celebrity, in addition to being someone I find hugely
inspiring and have a ton of respect for. If I'm being honest, I was really 
nervous about this.

The process was also different from other collaborations which typically start
with an idea that we then try to implement together.  Here, everything was
already done. Naomi already had the skirt and done all the work. The reason I
came  on board is because she wanted to offer it in a size-inclusive range. In
other words, it was my job to make her design parametric.

So one day in the spring of 2023, a package arrived on my doorstep all the way
from China. Inside it was Naomi Wu's very own cargo skirt. A veritable
smorgasbord of storage options in which even the pockets have pockets. 

It was a lot more elaborate than I anticipated, but somehow also very practical. 
It dawned on me as I was working on this that I should make one of these for
myself because I always misplace tools when I'm working on something. This is
like a tool chest that you can wear. Only better organized.

At Naomi's explicit request, I made the fronts reversible so they can me more
female or male presenting as you see fit (with the zipper being on this or that
side having certain significance towards gender-expression), and I added an
option to slope the waistband which will benefit more curvy people.

In the end, you get what it says on the tin: Naomi Wu's cargo skirt. Or at
least the close as you can get to the original item that landed on my doorstep
that fateful day.

I want to thank Naomi Wu for trusting FreeSewing -- and myself -- with her plans
to offer her skirt design as open source. I think it's a big deal for FreeSewing
to get this kind of recognition, and I know it was a big deal for me personally.

##### Naomi Who?

[Naomi Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Wu), also known by her online pseudonym *SexyCyborg* is a Chinese tech & DIY girl from Shenzhen, China.
She is known for her signature style blending DIY, electronics, and fashion, and has proven to be a
relentless advocate for women in STEM and LGBTQ rights.

Despite all prejudice and setbacks due to her gender expression, she managed to grow a large online audience, become a minor celebrity in the 3D-printers community, and at one point single-handedly compelled Chinese companies to take GPL-violations serious. As further testament to her status as a famous maker, she graced the cover of Make magazine in 2018.

As an outspoken Chinese citizen  with a tendency for telling it like it is, and a large international following, Noami drew the heat, and in the summer of 2023 the Chinese government de-facto silenced her. Ever since, her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/realsexycyborg) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reallysexycyborg/) accounts, and [YouTube channel](
www.youtube.com/c/SexyCyborg) have fallen silent. Although [her online shop remains available](https://cybernightmarket.com/).
