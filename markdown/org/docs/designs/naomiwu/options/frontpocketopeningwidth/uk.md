title: "Front pocket opening width"
---

This option controls the width of the front pockets opening.

A wider pocket opening is easier to access (put your hand in). It also increases the pocket width itself, as it will extend further to center front.

When extending this a lot, items pooling in the front pockets will move closer together, and from your leg into the space between your legs where they are more likely to dangle. So that's something to keep in mind when increasing the width of the front pocket opening.
