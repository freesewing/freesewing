title: "Invert the side of the fly"
---

This option allows you to flip the front sides of the skirt so that the fly/button goes on the other side.

The side at which the button goes is not functionally relevant, but some
garment (typically tops) have the buttons on teh right side for menswear, and
the left sife for womenswear.

The reasons for this are historic, but what matters is that to people with
gender presentation concerns, these little things can really matter.
