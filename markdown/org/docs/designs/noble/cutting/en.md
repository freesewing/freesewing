title: "Noble body block: Cutting Instructions"
---

**Main fabric**

- Cut **1 Front Inside** part on the fold.
- Cut **2 Front Outside** parts.

### Shoulder dart

- Cut **2 Back Inside** parts.
- Cut **2 Back Outside** parts.

### Armhole dart

- Cut **2 Back** parts.

These cutting instructions are just for the default Noble block. Adjust your cutting accordingly if you have/are making changes to the block.

<Tip>

If you do not have someone to help pin you into Noble then you may find it easier to Cut 2 Front Inside parts with seam allowance and sew the backs up when constructing so you can pin in the front.

<Note>

###### Noble is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.
