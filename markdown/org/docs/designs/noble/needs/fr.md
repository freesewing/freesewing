title: "Noble body block: What You Need"
---

To make Noble, you will need the following:

- Matériel de couture de base
- About 0.5 metres (0.6 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Noble Fabric options](/docs/patterns/noble/fabric/))

This list is for a default Noble Block. Si vous avez apporté des modifications au bloc, vous devrez peut-être vous procurer des éléments supplémentaires tels que des fermetures, des reliures, etc.

<Note>

###### Noble is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.
