title: "Благородний блок для тіла: Нотатки дизайнера"

Noble is a design for a block with prince(ss) seams instead of darts. It is based on `bella`.

This is not intended to be made as is, but merely to base other designs on. This is also why I made it. I wanted to make a coat, and for it I needed a block with prince(ss) seams. So I made that first, and the coat would come later.
