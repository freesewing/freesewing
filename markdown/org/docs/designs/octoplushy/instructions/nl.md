## Step 1: The Body

### The Face

- **Octoplushy**
  - With _good sides together_ sew four head parts together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A creating a semi-sphere like shape.
  - Repeat with the remaining four head parts to create a second half.
  - Use topstitching, or a long bar-tack, to make the mouth on one of the segments.
  - On the same section create eyes where the buttons are marked on the pattern.
  - With _good sides together_ sew the two head halves together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A.
  - Turn _good sides_ out.

<Note>

There are a couple of ways to make eyes for the Octoplushy version.
- Buttons
- Toy eyes
- Embroidery
- Felt or other suitable unravelling fabrics which can be combined with a _satin stitch_

</Note>

- **Octopus**
  - With _good sides together_ sew four head parts together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A creating a semi-sphere like shape.
  - Repeat with the remaining four head parts to create a second half.
  - With _wrong sides_ to _good sides_ sew the pupil to eyes parts.
  - With _good sides together_ sew both short ends of eyebrows together, creating a ring.
  - With _good sides together_ sew the eyebrows to the circumferences of the eyes, gathering the excess as you go.
  - Fold the eyebrows in half _wrong sides together_, and sew it again to the eyes. You may find it easier to hand sew this step.
  - Hand sew the eyes to the lower part of one of the head halves, so that you will have two sections between them when it all comes together.
  - With _good sides together_ sew the two head halves together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A.
  - Turn _good sides_ out.

<Note>

Before sewing the eyebrows in half, you can stuff the eyebrows to create a more dramatic looking eyebrow.

- **Squid**
  - With _good sides together_ sew four head parts together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A creating a semi-sphere like shape.
  - Repeat with the remaining four head parts to create a second half.
  - On the head (a) parts fold along the fold-line with _good sides together_.
  - Sew the straight line that juts out and then turn the flap _good sides_ out.
  - With _good sides together_ sew the non - flap edges of the head (a) parts to the one of the head halves sewn earlier, from notch B to the tip of the head part A.
  - With _wrong side_ to _good side_ sew the pupils to the eyes and finish their sides the best you can.
  - Hand Sew the eyes to the section closest to the legs.
  - With _good sides together_ sew the two halves together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A making sure that the flaps are on the outside.
  - Turn _good sides_ out.

## Step 2: The Legs

- **Octoplushy & Octopus**
  - With _good sides together_ sew four leg parts together, from notch D to the tip of the leg part C.
  - Repeat with the remaining four leg parts to create a second half.
  - With _good sides together_ sew the two leg halves together, from notch D to the tip of the leg part C but only one side. This other side stays open for stuffing later.

- **Squid**
  - With _good sides together_ sew four leg parts together, from notch D to the tip of the leg part C.
  - Repeat with the remaining four leg parts to create a second half.
  - With _good sides together_ sew a leg (a) part to each half so you have matching halves.
  - With _good sides together_ sew the two leg halves together, from notch D to the tip of the leg part C but only one side. This other side stays open for stuffing later.

## Step 3: Final Construction

- With _good sides together_ match up the leg parts with the body parts.
- Sew each leg from notch B/D down and back around to notch B/D.
- If the leg part is slightly shorter than the leg on the head partsm you will have to ease it in while matching it up. Notches have been provided to make this easier.

<Tip>

It is easiest to sew one leg almost to the next B/D notch, stop sewing, pin the next leg, and continue sewing rather than trying to pin and sew all the legs in one go. 

Those who are more confident can do this with the needle down on their machine but if you are less confident you may wish to remove from the machine, pin and then start sewing again a little bit over your originial stitching to secure it.
  
</Tip>

- Turn _good sides_ out.
- For Octopus sew along stitching lines of the legs before stuffing.
- Stuff the plushy through the opening in the legs.
- Hand sew the opening closed.
