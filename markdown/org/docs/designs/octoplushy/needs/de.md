Um Octoplushy zu erstellen, benötigst du Folgendes:

- [Grundlegendes Nähzubehör](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric (Upper body) ([see Octoplushy Fabric options](/docs/patterns/octoplushy/fabric/))
- About 0.75 meters (0.85 yards) of a suitable fabric (Belly) ([see Octoplushy Fabric options](/docs/patterns/octoplushy/fabric/))
- Either 2 buttons or a small piece of suitable unraveling, fabric for the eyes of the Octoplushy version
- Small piece of black fabric for the pupils of the Squid and Octopus versions
- Small piece of white fabric for the eyes of the Squid and Octopus versions
- (Optional) Topstitch or Embroidery thread for the mouth of the Octoplushy version
- Stuffing

<Note>

This list is based on a default Octoplushy and you may need less or more fabric dependant on the [size you are making Octoplushy](/docs/patterns/octoplushy/options/size/). 

The amount of fabric required is also dependant on the [type of Octoplushy you are making](/docs/patterns/octoplushy/options/type/).
- The Octopus version requires about 50% more fabric than the Octoplushy version.
- The Squid version requires about 75% more fabric than the Octoplushy version.

The color of the pupils and eyes for the Squid and Octopus versions are up to you, but for clarification and simplicity the pupils will be referred to as black and the eyes will be referred to as white in the documentation.
