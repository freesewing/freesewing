title: "Crotch gusset width"
---

Adjusts how wide the crotch gusset will be. The crotch gusset is a rectangular strip of fabric running up one leg, across the crotch fork, and down the other leg. It adds room in the crotch, creates a stronger outfit by avoiding the 4-way seam normally found at the crotch fork, and greatly reduces the need for scoops around the crotch fork.

Bodies that are wider than they are deep do not need as wide a gusset, while those with very deep thighs may need a wider gusset.

The width of the crotch gusset will affect how the garment is shaped around the hips, crotch, and upper legs. You may have to adjust the upper leg east, seat ease, and leg taper position along with this option to get a proper fit.
