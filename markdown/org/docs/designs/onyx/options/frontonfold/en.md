title: "Front on fold"
---

Controls if the front is made of of a single piece of fabric cut on the fold, or as two mirrored pieces that are sewn together down the center.

> Advantages: Saves a construction step, removes a seam, may be more comfortable.

> Disadvantages: Doesn't work with zippers, harder to fit a larger pattern piece on the fabric (may cause more fabric waste).

> ##### Zippers:

If using a front zipper, do _not_ enable this option.
