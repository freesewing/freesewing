title: "Leg ribbing length"
---

Controls how long the ribbing around the leg is, as a percentage of the leg circumference. Setting this to a smaller value will make the cuff tighter and hold onto the ankle better, while a larger value will give more room.

Note: This option is only available if the 'leg ribbing' option is set to 'ribbing.'
