title: "Leg taper position"

![The leg taper position option on Onyx](legtaperposition.svg)

Controls how the lower legs are laid out on the pattern.

Whether the legs taper inwards or outwards or down the middle will slightly affect the fit of the garment, and will affect the shape around the crotch fork and the upper legs. It's recommended to use a value for this option that produces the smoothest looking front and back pattern pieces.

Note: Setting this to 100% will generally produce pattern pieces that can be fit more efficiently onto the fabric.
