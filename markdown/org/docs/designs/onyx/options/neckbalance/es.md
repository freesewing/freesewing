![The neck position option on Onyx](neckbalance.svg)

Controls where the neck hole is placed on the garment. A value of 0% has the center of the neck hole exactly where the four raglan seams would intersect, with the front and back parts being identical and the sleeve being symmetrical. A positive value shifts the neck towards the front of the garment.
