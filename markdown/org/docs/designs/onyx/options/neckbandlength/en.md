title: "Neckband length"

![The neckband length option on Onyx](./neckbandwidth.svg)

Controls how long to make the neckband, as a percentage of the circumference of the neckline.

Too large a value will make for a loose neckband that doesn't hold its shape properly, while too small a value will cause the fabric around the neckband to be gathered.

Materials that stretch more easily should use smaller values. 80-85% is a reasonable value when using swim fabric, and 75% is a reasonable value for rib knit.
