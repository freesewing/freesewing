![The skirt waistband option on Onyx](skirtwaistband.svg)

Sets the width of the waistband along the top of the skirt, as a multiple of the seam allowance..

The waistband is a single fold hem that is topstitched into the main garment around the waist. The fold serves to hide and finish the top edge. It only needs to be wide enough to allow the topstitching to secure the skirt in place.
