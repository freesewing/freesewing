title: "Skirt width"

![The skirt width option on Onyx](skirtwidth.svg)

Controls the width of the skirt at the bottom, as a percentage of the waist measurement.

The top of the skirt is cut to the same width, and gathered around the waist. As such, a large value for this option will make a more heavily gathered skirt that is wide at the bottom.
