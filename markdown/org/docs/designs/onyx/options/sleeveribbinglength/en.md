title: "Sleeve ribbing length"
---

Controls how long the ribbing around the sleeves is, as a percentage of the sleeve circumference. Setting this to a smaller value will make the cuff tighter and hold onto the arm better, while a larger value will give more room. If making sleeves with thumb holes, it is recommended to set this value a little larger or to use a hem instead to avoid squeezing the hands.

Note: This option is only available if the 'sleeve ribbing' option is set to 'ribbing.'
