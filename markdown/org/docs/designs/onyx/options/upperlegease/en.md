![The upper leg ease option on Onyx](./upperlegease.svg)

Controls how wide the garment will be at your upper leg.

Whatever value you provide here will simply be added to your upper leg circumference measurement when drafting the garment.

> ##### This option also allows negative values.

> You should use negative ease if you are using a stretch material that you want to fit tightly. Unisuits and unitards typically have negative ease, while other garments typically have positive ease.
