title: "Zipper length"

![The zipper length option on Onyx](./zipperlength.svg)

Sets the length of the zipper, as a percentage of the vertical trunk. If you're using a precut zipper, you should adjust this option until the value shown below (in cm/in) matches the length of your zipper, measured from the lower stop to the upper stop.

Note: This option doesn't directly change the shape of the front or back pieces where the zipper is attached, but the zipper will be drawn onto the appropriate piece for reference, and will be used in drafting the zipper guard piece.
