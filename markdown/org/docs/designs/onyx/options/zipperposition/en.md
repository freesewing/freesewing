title: "Zipper position"
---

Choose whether to place the zipper on the front, the back, or to not use a zipper at all.

Front Zipper:
1: Easy for the wearer to reach the zipper.
2: Allows for a tight neckline.
3: Provides the least mobility of any option.

Back Zipper:
1: Allows greater mobility and stretch in the torso than a front zipper.
2: Allows for a tight neckline.
3: Can be hard to zip up and down by oneself.

No Zipper:
1: Allows maximum mobility and stretch in the torso.
2: Easy to put on and take off the garment.
3: Requires a very large neckline, since the neck must be able to stretch around the widest part of the hips.

Note: The zipper guard piece is only generated if a zipper is used.
