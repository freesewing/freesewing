title: "Opal Overalls: What You Need"
---

To make Opal, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- Between 1 - 3 meters (1.1 - 3.3 yards) of a suitable fabric, depending on size and style ([see Fabric options](/docs/designs/opal/fabric)).
- (optional) Fasteners to attach the straps to the front bib. I make my overalls using tack buttons on the bib, and a buckle and slider on each strap.

<Warning>

	- Long legs and a looser fit will increase fabric requirements. Pockets usually can be fit on the otherwise wasted portion of the fabric, and don't change the fabric length requirement.
	- A pair of shortalls for a typical adult will need about 2 meters of fabric.
	
</Warning>
