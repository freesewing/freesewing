title: "Opal Overalls: Designer Notes"
---

Opal is my third design. Like my first two designs (Shelly and Onyx), Opal has been designed to address my sensory needs. Overalls are loose, practical garments that don't cause the sensory issues that jeans cause, but are still a sturdy, practical garment that can be worn over other sensory clothes.

The lack of side buttons is due to these sensory issues - the garment is intended to be drafted loose enough to fit over the hips, and omitting the side buttons makes for a more comfortable garment, as well as making the overalls quite a fair bit easier to draft and make.

The fabric crossing over on the back bib adds strength and is a look I really like, which is why I drafted it that way.

Opal's name is in keeping with the gemstone theme of my designs.
