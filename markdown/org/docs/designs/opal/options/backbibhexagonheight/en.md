title: "Back bib hexagon height"
---

Controls how tall the hexagon formed by the straps crossing is. This is mostly a stylistic option, though higher values will produce a taller hexagonal crossing-over region, which will somewhat reduce the length of the straps and slightly reduce the coverage of the back bib, but should be a little stronger.
