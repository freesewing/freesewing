title: "Hem allowance"
---

Sets how wide the hems are around the front bib, back bib, and straps are. A larger hem will make the bibs and straps a little stiffer and stronger, but large values can make the curves harder to sew.

Note: This option does not change the hem around the legs. Use the Leg hem allowance options for that.
