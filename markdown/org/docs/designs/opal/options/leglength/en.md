title: "Leg length"
---

Controls how long the legs of the garment will be. A value of 100% should produce legs that reach the floor. Much smaller values (20%-60%) are used to draft a pattern for shortalls.

Note: The exact length needed will probably need tweaking, based on how the garment is intended to be worn. I recommend that you take a measuring tape, place one end where you want the top of the outseam to rest, measure from there to where you want the bottom of the legs to reach, and adjust this option so that the outseam of the drafted pattern is the right length.

Note: Too long is better than too short. Excess leg length can be hemmed, cuffed, or cut away, but it's hard to add more length to overalls that are too short.
