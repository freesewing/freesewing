title: "Outseam height"
---

Controls how far up past the waist the outseam extends, and thus how far up the front and back bibs separate.

Note: This option has a major effect on the overall style of your design. Larger values will give overalls with more side coverage and are more common in mens' or kids' overalls, while smaller values will expose more of the sides and are more common in feminine overalls. Larger values should produce a stronger (more tear-resistant) garment.
