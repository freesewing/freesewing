title: "Bib pocket style"
---

Choose among the available types/styles for the bib pocket:
- Pentagon: The bib pocket is in the shape of a pentagon. The feature options control the bottom-right and bottom-left points of the pentagon. This is the designer's preferred style, as it follows the trapezoidal shape of the front bib.
- Hexagon: The bib pocket is in the shape of a hexagon, similar to the style of the back pockets.
- Curved bottom: This is like 'hexagon,' but the two diagonal edges are curves instead of straight lines.
- Rectangle: The bib pocket is in the shape of a rectangle.
