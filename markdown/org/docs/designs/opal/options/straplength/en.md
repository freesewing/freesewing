title: "Strap length"
---

Controls how long the straps are. This option should generally be substantially larger than 100%, to allow the strap to be passed through the hardware. 160% is generally a good value to allow for a wide range of adjustments using the hardware.

Note: If not using hardware and permanently sewing the straps to the front bib, or if using non-adjustable buttons, a value of slightly over 100% should be used.
