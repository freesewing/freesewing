title: "Strap position"
---

Controls where the straps are positioned with respect to the hexagon. This option can only go negative, and smaller (more negative) values set the straps a little farther away from the centerline, which can affect how they fit around the shoulders.

Note: If you don't have a good reason to change this, it is recommended to leave it at the default (0%).
