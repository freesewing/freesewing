title: "Strap taper position"
---

Controls how long the tapered portion of the straps is. Setting this value too low can make for unnatural-looking straps, but the larger this value is set, the smaller the range over which the straps can be adjusted, since the slider can't fit over the tapered portion of the straps. It is recommended to set this to as small a value as will still produce nice-looking straps.
