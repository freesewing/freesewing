title: "Thigh shape"

Controls how elongated the thighs of the garment are. Higher values are used for deeper but narrower thighs.

This controls the transition between the trunk (one big tube) and the legs (two smaller tubes). The two legs will always require more fabric than the trunk, but the shape of the thighs affects how much more fabric is needed. This option is used to account for this.
