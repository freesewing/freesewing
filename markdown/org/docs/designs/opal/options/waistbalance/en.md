title: "Waist balance"
---

Controls the position of the side seam at the waist. Positive values will cause the front piece to be wider, while negative values will cause the back piece to be wider.

Note: The side seam in this design is always straight. Instead, all adjustments are made by moving the center seam.

Note: For most people, this option will be set more positive/less negative than the seat balance.
