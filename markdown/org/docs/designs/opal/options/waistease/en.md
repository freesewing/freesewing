title: "Waist ease"
---

Controls how wide the garment will be around the waist.

Note: This overalls design does not feature any side closure. As such, there must be enough ease in the waist for the garment to slide over the widest part of the hips. As such, waist ease should usually be set to fairly large positive value. If the waist ease is too narrow, you may make a garment that cannot be put on or taken off.
