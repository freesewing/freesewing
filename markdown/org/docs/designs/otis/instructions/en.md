<Note>

You should use a stretch stitch on your sewing machine. Small zig-zag stitches work really well. The side seams can also be done with a serger.

</Note>

## Step 1: Bindings

### Two options

There are two ways to do the bindings. You can use it like double-folded bias binding, or just fold it in two and stitch that to the pieces. The double-folding will look nicer and more finished, but is a lot more involved.

#### Double-folded

  - Fold both bindings along the long side in two, _wrong sides together_, and give it a good press.
  - Mark the middle of each of the bindings (notch) and of the front and back parts. 
  - Attach the binding to the corresponding part, _good sides together_. Make sure you distribute the binding evenly along the edge. 
  - Sew just shy of the SA. 
  - Press the binding towards the edge and flip your part over. 
  - Now fold the remaining SA under and press. 
  - Sew this side of the binding to the part through all five layers.

#### Fold and stitch

  - Fold both bindings along the long side in two, _wrong sides together_, and give it a good press.
  - Mark the middle of each of the bindings and of the front and back parts. 
  - Attach the folded binding to the corresponding part, _good sides together_. Make sure you distribute the binding evenly along the edge. You should have three layers pinned together.
  - Sew just shy of the SA. 
  - Press the binding towards the edge, pressing the SA towards the _wrong side_.
  - Sew through the part and the SA underneath, holding the folded SA on the _wrong side_.

## Step 2: Attach body parts

  - Lay the back and front parts with the _good sides up_, tops facing each other.
  - Lay the front part shoulders on top of the back part shoulders, aligning the notches on the left and right.
  - Baste or pin together.

## Step 3: Attach sleeves

  - Mark the middle of the shoulder of each sleeve.
  - Pin the sleeve to the two body parts, aligning the middle of the sleeve with the shoulder notch.
  - Distribute the sleeve evenly along the opening.
  - Sew the pieces together.

## Step 4: Prepare snap placket

  - (Optional) If your fabric is flimsy, or very stretchy, cut a piece of iron-on interfacing the size of the snap placket and iron it in place.
  - Press the SA of the snap placket over, and then press the snap placket in two.
  - Sew just along the inner edge on the snap placket.

## Step 5: Body

  <Note>

You can reinforce the sleeve openings now if you're so inclined. Add some iron-on interfacing tape to the hem of the sleeve. This will keep the sleeve opening looking nice if you have flimsy or stretchy fabric.

  </Note>

  - Press the sleeve SA and hem over, so it'll be easier to sew the hem once you've done the next steps.
  - Pin both front and back sides together, _wrong sides out_, from the leg opening all the way to the arm opening in the sleeve.
  - Sew the whole seam on both sides.
  - Turn the romper _good sides out_.

## Step 6: Hem

  - Fold the hems on the sleeves in.
  - Sew them in place.

## Step 7: Leg binding

  - Fold the leg binding in two length-wise, _wrong sides together_, and press.
  - Hold the ends _good sides together_, and sew the SA at the ends.
  - Fold the binding back, _wrong sides together_.
  - Pin the binding to the leg opening, matching the notch to the side seam, and the beginning and end to the snap placket.
  - Sew this binding to the leg opening like you did with the earlier bindings.

## Step 8: Snaps

  - Mark the position of the snaps along the snap placket, evenly distributed.
  - Install the studs on the _good side_ of the back part, and the sockets on the _wrong side_ of the front part.

## Step 9: Done!

Give it a good press all around and take a moment to enjoy the new romper. This will be the last time it will ever look this nice.
