title: "Otis, the simple baby romper: What You Need"
---

To make Otis, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/designs/otis/fabric/))
- 3 snaps.
- A little bit of interfacing if your fabric is very stretchy.

<Note>

You can use a different color fabric for the bindings to give it some additional flair.
