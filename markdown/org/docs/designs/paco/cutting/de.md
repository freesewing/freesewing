<Tip>

###### Cut out only what you need

Depending on the choices you made in your pattern, you may not need all parts.
If a pattern part is not printed, it means you don't need it.

</Tip>

- From your main fabric:
  - 2x **part 1**: This is the back panel. Cut these from your **main fabric** with _good sides together_
  - 2x **part 2**: This is the front panel. Cut these from your **main fabric** with _good sides together_
  - 2x **part 3**: This is the waistband. Cut it from your **main fabric**
  - 2x **part 4**: This is the ankle cuff. Cut these, from your **main fabric** with _good sides together_ (not needed if your chose not to have an elasticated hem)
  - 2x **part 7**: This is the back pocket welt. Cut 2 of these from your **main fabric** with _good sides together_
- From your lining fabric:
  - 2x **part 5**: This is the front pocket bag. Cut these, from your **lining fabric** _on the fold_ (not needed if you chose to not have front pockets)
  - 2x **part 6**: This is the back pocket bag. Cut 2 of these from your **lining fabric** _on the fold_
- From interfacing:
  - 2x **part 8**: This is the back pocket welt interfacing. Cut 2 of these from **interfacing**

<Warning>

#### Caveats

- There is no seam allowance on the interfacing
- There is extra seam allowance on the waist band and hem
- The waistband is a mere rectangle, so it's not fully printed to save paper

</Warning>
