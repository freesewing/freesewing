title: "Length bonus"
- - -

Controls the length of the entire trousers, which essentially means the length of the legs.

<Note>

Setting this to zero will make the trousers the same length as the [waist to floor](/docs/measurements/waisttofloor) measurement.

This does not mean that the trousers will hit the floor, since due to the curves of the body and the way the fabric drapes,
the trousers will need to be longer than this to actually hit the floor.
