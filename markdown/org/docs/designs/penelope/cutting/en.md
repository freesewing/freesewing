<Note>

The number of back parts depends on whether you want a vent, or have moved the zipper to the back seam.  
Either one of these options will require you to cut out two individual back parts. Otherwise the back is cut on the fold.  
Due to this, the cutting list does not specify how many back parts to cut as the pattern options determine this.

</Note>

**Main Fabric**

- Cut **1 front** part on fold.
- Cut **back** part(s).
- (Optional) Cut **1 waistband** parts on the fold.

**Lining Fabric (Optional)**

- Cut **1 front** part on fold.
- Cut **back** part(s).

<Note>

[See Penelope Instructions](/docs/designs/penelope/instructions/#lining) to understand alterations to the front and back parts required for the lining.

</Note>

**Interfacing**

- Cut **1 waistband** part on the fold.

<Tip>

When you cut out a piece on the fold, remember that the fold does not need to be in the middle of the fabric.
Choosing the placement of your pieces wisely can greatly reduce the amount of fabric you need for your skirt.
