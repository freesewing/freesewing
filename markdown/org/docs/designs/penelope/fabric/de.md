### Main Fabric

A pencil skirt is a rather formal cut, and most commonly is made in a suiting material. In other words, a **fine wool**. More casual options among **medium weight** fabrics include **cotton** or **denim**.

Einen Stoff mit etwas Dehnbarkeit zu verwenden wird es einfacher machen, eine bequeme Passform zu bekommen, und dir mehr Bewegungsfreiheit geben, da Bleistiftröcke ziemlich eng sitzen. **Scuba** is often seen in pencil skirts as it is firm, has body but also stretchs.

### Lining Fabric

The lining fabric needs to be light, and allow the body to slide over it easily. You also don't want something to thick as this will be constricting. **Silky** fabrics are the go to choice as they are lightweight and slippery.
