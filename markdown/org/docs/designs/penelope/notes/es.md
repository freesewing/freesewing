title: "Falda lápiz Penélope: Notas del diseñador"
---

Penelope is the first garment I made for someone else. I just met my partner after figuring out that I like to sew. So obviously I wanted to sew something for her. This fitted remarkably well. A pencil skirt seemed like the appropriate thing to do. I found a drafting method online and made her a skirt.

So when it was time for me to try making another pattern for FreeSewing, this was the obvious choice. I used the same basis for the drafting, but changed everything to percentages, so it would scale from dolls to giants.

The design should not pose any issues for a sewist, although the hidden zipper may be a challenge, specially if you line the skirt (which I would recommend).
