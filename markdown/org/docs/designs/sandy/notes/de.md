title: "Sandiger Kreisrock: Designer Notes"

Sandy war mein erstes Muster, nachdem ich das LÃ¤tzchen-Tutorial gemacht hatte. Usually, no one needs a pattern to make a circle skirt, you just fold your fabric, run your numbers and cut the circle. However, I wanted an automated way to get those numbers and that was not limited to a full or half circle, so I decided to make the pattern. Additionally, I gave it the option to have an accurately curved waistband, which I use also for other projects.

The name is a tribute to Sandy, Olivia Newton John's character in Grease, who wears a fair amount of circle skirts as a typical 50s teenager.
