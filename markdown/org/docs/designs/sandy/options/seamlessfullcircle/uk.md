![Seamless full circle](seamlessfullcircle.svg)

Select 'yes' for a seamless circle, which is cut on a double fold. Since it has no openings, you'll need an elastic waistband.

<Note>

- This produces a full circle ignoring the _Circle percent_ option.
- You may need to use the [gathering option](sandy/options/gathering) to increase the waist circumference to fit over your seat/hips.
- You will need to set the [waistband overlap](sandy/options/waistbandoverlap) to 0%.

</Note>
