<Note>

You can use this pattern to make a crop-top by just omitting the bottom entirely, so skipping steps 2 and 3.

</Note>

## Step 1: Prep the top

- Sew the front and back _good sides together_ on:
    - the tops of both arms
    - both sides; by the sleeves turn and catch a bit of the seam allowance for better structural integrity

## Step 2: Prep the bottom

- Sew the bottom seam  _good sides together_.

## Step 3: Connect the parts

- Turn the top inside out, so it's no longer good sides together.
- Put the bottom around the top, aligning the waist. The seam on the bottom should be in the middle of the back.
- Sew the two parts _good sides together_.

## Step 4: Hemming

- Double fold and hem the sleeves.
- Double fold and hem the bottom.
- Hem the neckhole; the neckhole is supposed to be quite wide.

## Step 5: Enjoy!

You are all done! Now enjoy the shirt, perhaps try going spinny.
