title: "Armpit ease"
---

Shifts the sleeves downward to give extra room in the armpit, measured as a percentage of the sleeve diameter. If in doubt, go with the default value.

Note: This option does not change the diameter of the sleeve. To make the sleeve larger or smaller, use the Sleeve ease option.

Note: The Raglan scoop length and Raglan scoop depth options also affect the amount of ease in the armpit.

> ##### Cette option permet également des valeurs négatives.
> 
> Negative values will move the sleeves upwards. Use with caution, even on stretch garments, as this can easily cause binding at the armpit.
