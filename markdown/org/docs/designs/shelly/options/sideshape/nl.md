title: "Side shape"
---

Controls how the side seam is curved. Zero creates a straight line from the armpit to the side of the hips. Positive values add material and give the side seam a rounded/convex shape, while negative values remove material and give the side seam an hourglass/concave shape. This option will have no effect if the 'straight sides' option is enabled.
