Affects how wide the end of the sleeve is on some shirts. There is no effect for sleeves ending at the biceps or above. For longer sleeves, the wrist measurement and this wrist ease option have a progressively larger effect, reaching full effect for long sleeved shirts (sleeve length of 100% or greater).
