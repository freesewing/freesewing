title: "Simon shirt: Designer Notes"
---

Simon is the first design where I really wanted to flex my muscles and show
what's possible with parametric design.

I think that if I did it today, I'd probably make a couple of different styles
that each extend a more basic shirt design.  But, as I mentioned, this design
was created in the early stages of my journey into parametric design, so I
really wanted to see what was possible.

The result is a shirt patterns with *a ton* of options that you can turn into a
variety of styles.  It's also popular among people as a basic block, as it's
more fitted than [Brian](/designs/brian) which Simon is based on.

All in all, this is probable one of FreeSewing's more famous designs.
