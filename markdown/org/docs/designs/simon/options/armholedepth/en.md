title: "Armhole depth"
---

This option controls the depth of the armhole.

This option applies to the new v3 way of calculating the armhole depth.
If you enable the [legacy armhole depth](/docs/designs/simon/options/legacyarmholedepth) option, this option will not apply, but instead it's legacy version [armhole depth factor](/docs/designs/simon/options/armholedepthfactor) will.
