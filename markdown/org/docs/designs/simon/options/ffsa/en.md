title: "Flat-felled seam allowace"

Controls the amount of seam allowance on flat-felled seams.

The armhole and side seams on the shirt are flat-felled seams, and those require extra seam allowance.
How much is a matter of personal preference, since some people prefer wider flat-felled seams,
while others have a preference for more narrow flat-felled seams.

This option controls the amount of flat-felled seam allowance as a factor of the regular seam allowance.
