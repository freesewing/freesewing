How much do you want the hem to curve upwards?

<Note>

- This applies only to the baseball and slashed hem styles. If you chose a straight hem, this will be ignored.
- This value can never be more than the length bonus. If it is, it will silently be set to the length bonus value.
- If you set this to zero, you'll get a straight hem regardless of what hem style you pick.
