Do you want a split yoke?

<Note>

###### What's the point?

With a split yoke, only half the yoke is included on the pattern, and you'll have to cut 4 parts instead of 2, and sew them together.

It's a bit more work, but it allows you to align the grain line differently on both halves of the yoke, an effect that some people like.
