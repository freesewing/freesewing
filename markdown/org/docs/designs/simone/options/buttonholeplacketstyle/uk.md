![Buttonhole placket style](buttonholeplacketstyle.svg)

Do you want classic buttonhole placket, or a seamless one (sometimes called French style)?

<Tip>

Seamless is less work, and it looks great.

</Tip>

<Note>

As seamless is only possible on a _cut-on_ placket, this option is ignored if you choose a seperate buttonhole placket.
