![Button placket style](buttonplacketstyle.svg)

Do you want the button placket to be sewn in place (classic style), or folded back and held in place by the buttons (seamless style)?

<Tip>

Seamless is less work, and it looks great.

</Tip>

<Note>

As seamless is only possible on a _cut-on_ placket, this option is ignored if you choose a separate button placket.
