![Length bonus](lengthbonus.svg)

How much shirt do you want to be able to tuck in your trousers?

<Note>

###### What's the point?

Keeping your shirt tucked neatly in your trousers is why you need this extra length.
Nobody needs to know about that Justin Bieber tattoo on your lower back.

If you want a more casual shirt to wear over your trousers, you will want to lower this.
