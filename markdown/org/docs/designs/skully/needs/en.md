title: "Skully: What You Need"
---

To make Skully, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Skully Fabric options](/docs/designs/skully/fabric/))
- Stuffing
- Embroidery floss for the hair
- Appropriately sized upholstery needle

<Note>

This list is based on a default Skully and you may need less or more fabric dependant on the [size you are making Skully](/docs/designs/skully/options/size/).

For instance a 300% Skully will need 1.5 meters (0.5 meter x 300%  = 1.5 meters) and a 50% skully will need 0.25 meters (0.5 meter x 50% = 0.25 meters).
