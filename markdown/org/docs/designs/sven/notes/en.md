title: "Sven sweatshirt: Designer Notes"

I don't knit, but I do tend to be cold all the time. So I do like sweaters.
Hence why I designed this sweater pattern, because I prefer to make clothes rather than buy them.

It's a pretty simple design, essentially a light variation of the [Brian
block](/designs/brian) that it is based on.
