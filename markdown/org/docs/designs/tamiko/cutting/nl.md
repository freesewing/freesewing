- **Buitenstof**
  - Knip **1 Tamiko top** aan de stofvouw

Tamiko is a zero-waste pattern. It's a rectangle that's cut out on the fold. Not more than that. There's only one part to this top, we will simply refer to it at the **Tamiko top**. It needs to be cut on the fold along the bottom.

Knip het armsgat uit, maar laat naadwaarde over
