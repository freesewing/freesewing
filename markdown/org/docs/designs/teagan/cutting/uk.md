title: "Teagan T-shirt: Cutting Instructions"
---

- Cut 1 back on the fold.
- Cut 1 front on the fold.
- Cut 2 sleeves _with good sides together_
  - If you cut sleeves separately, remember that one has to be a mirror image of the other.
- Cut 1 strip for neck opening. It should be 6 cm wide and the length of your neck opening.

## Caveats

- There is no seam allowance on the neck opening.
- There is extra hem allowance at the hem and armholes.
