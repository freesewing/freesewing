![Back rise](backrise.svg)

This raises the waist of your trousers at the back.

<Note>

This trouser pattern is based on the drafting method of Winifred Aldrich.
One complain I often get is that the back of the trousers is too low.
It's a valid complaint too, it is low.

This option allows you to mitigate that, without dramatic changes to the pattern.
It allows you to simply raise the back of the trousers.
