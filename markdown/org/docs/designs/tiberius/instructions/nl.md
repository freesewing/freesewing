<Note>

Tiberius is a historically inspired pattern, and if you want more authenticity, handsewing is the way to go. Personally, I use a sewing machine. Jullie doen jullie.

### Step 1: Sew shoulder seams

- Put both parts with good sides together. Sew the shoulder seams, taking care to stop at the notches for the head opening.
- Finish the seams, with a method of your choice. (If you used the fabrics recommended in the [fabric options](/docs/patterns/tiberius/fabric), they _will_ fray. Folding the seam allowance twice, enclosing the raw edge and topstitching is an option. You can also use decorative topstitching.)

<Note>

If you opted for cutting the whole tunica out of one piece, carefully cut out the head opening between the notches instead. Finish the opening.

### Step 2: Sew side seams

- Still with good sides together, sew the side seams. Start at the notch for the armhole and work your way down. Take care to align your layers properly.
- Finish seams.

### Step 3: Hem the bottom edge

Hem the bottom of your garment. If you want to use decorative stitches, this is another place to use them.

### Step 4: You're done!

Pull on your tunica, belt it around your waist, play around with how you gather the fabric, and enjoy!
