title: "Tiberio Tunica: Notas del diseñador"

<Note compact>Lunetius, Tiberius and Walburga really come as a set. Not only were they born at the same time, they are designed to work together to form a full outfit. Not that this means that they can't be made separately ;)</Note>

Tiberius was the first of the bunch, and also the simplest: a simple, nice *tunica*, inspired by the ones worn by Romans in the late republic, early empire (I can tell you that I read quite a lot of references and looked at pictures of statues and reliefs to figure out the "how long should it be?" question). This was a garment I wanted to make as part of a costume for my TTRPG (table-top roleplaying game) character, who is kind of a fantasy Roman. While writing down my measurements to make the *tunica*, I realised that this was such a simple parametric design that it could be a way for me to dip my toes into the coding part of Freesewing. And so I did. Even though it's "only" a rectangle, I tried to put some things into it behind the scenes (seams?), some failchecks to ensure that it results in a wearable garment. Since it's only a rectangle, there is not much wriggle room (pun intended) for fit, making it nice and easy but also challenging when you want to achieve a certain look (the length of the apparent "sleeves", for example). Quite fascinating, One slightly hidden feature is the possibility to add positional markers for *clavi*, strips of colour on the *tunica* to denote rank and/or class.

The name is taken from James T. Kirk, by the way, who luckily had parents who seemingly liked some debatable Roman emperors.
