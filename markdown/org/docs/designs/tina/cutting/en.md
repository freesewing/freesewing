- **Main fabric**
  - Cut *1 Back* on the fold.
  - Cut *2 Front(s)* mirrored.
  - Cut *1 Front Bottom* (if present).
  - Cut *2 Sleeve(s)* mirrored (if enabled).
- **Ribbing**
  - Cut 1 *Neck Binding*.
  - Cut 2 *Armhole Binding(s)* or *Cuff(s)* (depending on selected options).
  - Cut 1 *Waistband* (if enabled).

## Caveats

- There is extra hem allowance at the bottom hem if there is no *Waistband* part.
- There is extra hem allowance at the sleeve part if there is no *Cuff* part.
- There is no seam allowance on the diagonals and the back of the neck.
- There is no seam allowance on the armhole if the sleeve is disabled.
- There is no seam allowance on the long sides of the *Armhole Binding* and *Neck Binding* parts.

<Note>
If your fabric is elastic enough, you can cut all parts from the same fabric. 
Alternatively, you can use ribbing fabric or store bought knit binding for the parts in the ribbing section.
