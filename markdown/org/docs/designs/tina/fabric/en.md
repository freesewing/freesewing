Tina designed as a close-fitting top and is best suited to knit fabrics with some stretch, such as jersey.

Other elastic fabric such as sweatshirt or swimwear fabric could also work.

<Tip>
If you're new to sewing, interlock jersey is nice to work with, as it doesn't roll up. Prefer jersey with a few percent spandex for better recovery. Fabric weights can also help you make your choice. A weight of 130-200 grams per square meter (or 4-6 ounces per square yard) is likely to be about right.
