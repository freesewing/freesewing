title: "Tina top: What You Need"
---

To make Tina, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1 - 3 metres (1.1 - 3.3 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Tina Fabric options](/docs/designs/tina/fabric/))
  - A short crop top without sleeves needs probably less than a meter, a long dress with sleeves needs much more fabric.

<Note>

##### A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life easier.
If you do not have one of those, don’t despair. You don’t really need it. All serged seams on Tina can also be sewn with a short, narrow zigzag stitch (~2 mm wide) on a standard sewing machine.
