Controls the influence of the seat back measurement on the garment width.

* At 0%, the front and back parts will have the same widths around the seat, equal to half the seat measurement (plus ease).
* At 100%, the back part will have a width equal to the seat back measurement (plus ease) and the front part will cover the remaining seat measurement (plus ease).
