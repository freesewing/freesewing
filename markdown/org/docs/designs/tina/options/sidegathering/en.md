How much the bottom end of the diagonal band is pulled down instead of sewing it straight on.
This stretches the diagonal band a little and also creates some folds near the side seam that you might like for design reasons.

This option can reduce or prevent gaping, similar to the *Front ease* option, but could result in a bad fit if overdone.
