title: "Allow splitting the front part"

By default, if there is a large overlapping section on the front part, the front part will be split
into a top part, which overlaps, and a bottom part, which is a single layer.
This reduces bulk, fabric usage and the large bag-like space in the front.

However, if you like to not split the front part, you can disable this option.
