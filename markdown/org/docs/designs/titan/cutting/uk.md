title: "Titan trouser block: Cutting Instructions"
- - -

**Main fabric**

- Cut **2 front** parts with _good sides together_
- Cut **2 back** parts with _good sides together_

These cutting instructions are just for the default Titan block. Adjust your cutting accordingly if you have/are making changes to the block.

<Note>

###### Titan is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.
