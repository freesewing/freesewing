title: "Titan trouser block: Fabric Options"
- - -

If you are making a default Titan to see how it fits we recommend a fabric such as **Calico (Muslin)** or a cheaper fabric that matches the drape and stretch of the fabric you intend to make a finalised version of Titan with.

You can use scraps of fabrics from your stash so don't worry about buying fabric specifically for Titan.

<Note>

###### Titan is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.
