<Note>

###### Titan is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
A veces también se llaman trampas, aunque los puristas argumentarán que un bloque y una inclinación son cosas diferentes.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns so the instructions below will not go in depth about closures or finishes and are for the default Titan block.

### Step 1: Mock-up Construction

- Únete a la costura exterior (la costura que corre a lo largo del lado de la pierna) de la parte frontal y trasera.
- Únete a la costura (la costura corre a lo largo del interior de tus piernas) de la parte frontal y trasera.
- Ahora tienes una pierna. Repeat for the other leg, **making certain they are mirror images of each other**.
- Gire una pierna con el lado bueno y la otra con el lado bueno fuera.
- Now tuck the _good side out_ into the _good side in_ leg, so that they have their _good sides together_.
- Align and sew the cross seam.

<Note>

You may need to leave an opening in the front cross seam so you can pin yourself in.

</Note>

<Tip>

If you are making adjustments you may wish to sew the seams wrong sides together to make them easier to adjust.

</Tip>

### Step 2: Try it on

- Try it on and check the fit by pinning the front closed whilst wearing it.
- Make any alterations and try it on again.
- Repite hasta que te satisfaga.

<Tip>

Keep an eye out for anything you keep doing whilst wearing the mock-up, are you pulling it down? Constantly adjusting the shoulder? etc. etc. etc. Cosas como estas son signos de que el patrón puede necesitar ajustes.

Sometimes you may need to wear the mock-up for an extended amount of time to get a better sense of the fit so don't be afraid to walk around in it for a couple of hours.

</Tip>

<Note>

Remember to treat Titan as a basis rather than a final product, so adjust what you need to get the desired look.\
For instance:

- Add a front closure
- Add pockets
- Change the pant length
- Change the pant width
- Add a waistband

It is all up to you!
For instance:

- Add a front closure
- Add pockets
- Change the pant length
- Change the pant width
- Add a waistband

It is all up to you! Experiment and go forth!

### Step 3: Make a paper pattern

- Once happy with all your changes unpick your mockup and make a paper pattern based off of it.
- Now you have a pattern you can use to produce a garment.

<Note>

It is best practice to make a paper pattern from the mock-up if you have made any alterations, as this will allow you to clean up any lines but also means you have a pattern that you can keep producing garments from.
