<Note>

###### Titan is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
Dit wordt soms ook een paspatroon genoemd, alhoewel puristen zeggen dat dit twee verschillende dingen zijn.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns so the instructions below will not go in depth about closures or finishes and are for the default Titan block.

### Step 1: Mock-up Construction

- Stik de buitennaad aan (de naad die langs de zijkant van je been loopt) van het voor- en achterpand.
- Bevestig de binnennaad (de naad die langs de binnenkant van je broekspijp) van de voor- en achterpand.
- Je hebt nu een been. Repeat for the other leg, **making certain they are mirror images of each other**.
- Keer de ene broekspijp met de goede kant in, en de andere met de goede kant naar buiten.
- Now tuck the _good side out_ into the _good side in_ leg, so that they have their _good sides together_.
- Align and sew the cross seam.

<Note>

You may need to leave an opening in the front cross seam so you can pin yourself in.

</Note>

<Tip>

If you are making adjustments you may wish to sew the seams wrong sides together to make them easier to adjust.

</Tip>

### Step 2: Try it on

- Try it on and check the fit by pinning the front closed whilst wearing it.
- Make any alterations and try it on again.
- Repeat until you are happy.

<Tip>

Keep an eye out for anything you keep doing whilst wearing the mock-up, are you pulling it down? Constantly adjusting the shoulder? etc. etc. etc. Things like these are signs of where the pattern may need adjusting.

Sometimes you may need to wear the mock-up for an extended amount of time to get a better sense of the fit so don't be afraid to walk around in it for a couple of hours.

</Tip>

<Note>

Remember to treat Titan as a basis rather than a final product, so adjust what you need to get the desired look.\
For instance:

- Add a front closure
- Add pockets
- Change the pant length
- Change the pant width
- Add a waistband

It is all up to you!
For instance:

- Add a front closure

It is all up to you! Experiment and go forth!

### Step 3: Make a paper pattern

- Once happy with all your changes unpick your mockup and make a paper pattern based off of it.
- Now you have a pattern you can use to produce a garment.

<Note>

It is best practice to make a paper pattern from the mock-up if you have made any alterations, as this will allow you to clean up any lines but also means you have a pattern that you can keep producing garments from.
