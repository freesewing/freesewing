title: "Titan trouser block: What You Need"
---

To make Titan, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.5 meters (1.7 yards) of suitable fabric ([see Titan Fabric options](/docs/patterns/titan/fabric))

<Note>

###### Titan is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.
