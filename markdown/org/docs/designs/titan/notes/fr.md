title: "Bloc pantalon Titan : Notes du créateur"

I am very happy Titan exists because making a trouser block that works for a variety of bodies is no simple task.

I had started on this a couple of times on my own, but for various reasons was never happy and abandoned the effort more than once.

But when I teamed up with Debra Bean, we were able to finally get the job done and Titan is now FreeSewing's foundational trouser block.

Je tiens à remercier Deb pour sa patiente collaboration et ses précieux commentaires. Sans cela, je n'aurais peut-être jamais terminé cette tâche.
