title: "Titan broekenblok: Ontwerpnotities"
---

I am very happy Titan exists because making a trouser block that works for a variety of bodies is no simple task.

I had started on this a couple of times on my own, but for various reasons was never happy and abondoned the effort more than once.

But when I teamed up with Debra Bean, we were able to finally get the job done and Titan is now FreeSewing's foundational trouser block.

Ik wil Deb bedanken voor haar geduldige samenwerking en waardevolle input. Zonder dat zou ik deze taak misschien nooit hebben volbracht.
