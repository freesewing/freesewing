title: "Titan trouser block: Designer Notes"
---

I am very happy Titan exists because making a trouser block that works for a variety of bodies is no simple task.

I had started on this a couple of times on my own, but for various reasons was never happy and abondoned the effort more than once.

But when I teamed up with Debra Bean, we were able to finally get the job done and Titan is now FreeSewing's foundational trouser block.

I'd like to thank Deb for her patient collaboration and valuable input. Without it, I might have never finished this task.
