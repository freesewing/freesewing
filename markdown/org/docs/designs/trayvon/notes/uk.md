title: "Trayvon tie: Designer Notes"
---

There's about a million patterns for ties on the internet, so why make another one, right?

Well, this started hen I wanted to make a tie but every pattern I found was cutting corners. Specifically, they all put the seam between the back and the font at the exact tip. Which, sure, is easier to make. But that's not how ties are supposed to be made.

So, I designed this pattern so I could make ties that looks professional, and not home-made.

I gave it the name `trayvon` in memory of [Trayvon Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trayvon_Martin) and more generally to honour the memory of all victims of brutality at the hands of people in a position of authority.
