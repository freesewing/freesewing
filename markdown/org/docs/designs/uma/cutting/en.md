title: "Uma undies: Cutting Instructions"
---

Uma typically consists of a front, a back, and a lined gusset.
In that constallation, this is the cut list:

- **Main fabric**
  - Part 1: Cut **1 front**
  - Part 2: Cut **1 back**
  - Part 3: Cut **2 gusset** 

However, if you enable the **Bulge** option, the front and gusset will become 1 part.
In this case, the cutlist looks like this:

- **Main fabric**
  - Part 1: Cut **1 front**
  - Part 2: Cut **1 back**

<Note>

##### Notes

- Uma is a great scrap buster. If you have fabric scraps from making a [Teagan t-shirt](/designs/teagan/) or anything from a jersey fabric that has good stretch, this is a good way to use those up.
- You can use the same fabric for the whole garment, including the gusset lining. Some people prefer to use a cotton jersey instead to line the gusset. If you want to do that, cut **1 gusset** from your main fabric and **1 gusset** from your lining fabric.
