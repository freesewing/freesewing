title: "Uma Unterhosen: Designer Notes"
---

This design is inspired by an earlier design (Ursula) which was created by my friend Natalia.

In the run-up to the v3 release, we discussed the migration of the various designs, and it became clear that for reasons (gestures vaguely towards people on the internet being rather unappreciative) the original designer was reluctant to continue maintaining their design.

Since it's a rather nice design not to mention a popular one, we agreed that I would reincarnate the pattern. While at it, I also mase some changes that people had been asking for, such as the bulge option to make it gender-neutral.

Lange Rede kurzer Sinn:

- Alles, was an diesem Entwurf so toll ist, verdanken wir Natalia.
- Alles, was an diesem Design nervt, liegt an mir.
