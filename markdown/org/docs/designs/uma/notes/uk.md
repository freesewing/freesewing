title: "Uma undies: Designer Notes"

This design is inspired by an earlier design (Ursula) which was created by my friend Natalia.

In the run-up to the v3 release, we discussed the migration of the various designs, and it became clear that for reasons (gestures vaguely towards people on the internet being rather unappreciative) the original designer was reluctant to continue maintaining their design.

Since it's a rather nice design not to mention a popular one, we agreed that I would reincarnate the pattern. While at it, I also mase some changes that people had been asking for, such as the bulge option to make it gender-neutral.

Long story short:

- Everything that is great about this design is thanks to Natalia.
- Everything that sucks about this design is on me.
