This option allows you to create room at the front like on briefs.
Room that you can use to hold a snack, or other things that you may want to carry there.

Enabling this option has a number of side-effects:

- It will override the gusset location
- It will join the front and gusset into a single part
- It will no longer be possible to cut the front/gusset on the fold
