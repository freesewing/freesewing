<Note>
Ensure that yor measurements are based on a fixed waistline. If you have difficulty determining where your waist is, tie a string around your body at approximately the right height (usually a little below the ribs or where your skin folds if you bend sideways).
Use this as a reference line for the other measurements.
The exact waist height is not crucial, but it is essential to maintain consistency in the other measurements. 
</Note>

<Note>
To measure the cross seam precisely, exclude your genitals. Place the measuring tape alongside the inside of one of your legs, rather than over the center of your body. Extra room for your genitals can be added through the bulge option.
