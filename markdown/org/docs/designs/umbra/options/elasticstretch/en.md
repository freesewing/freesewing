This option controls how much the elastic band is stretched relative to the fabric.

This determines how much smaller the waistband elastic length will be shown relative to the actual waistband circumference.
The same applies for the leg holes.

If your main fabric is not very elastic, you should probably increase this so that the undies hold up well.
If your main fabric is already very elastic, you can go close to 0%.
