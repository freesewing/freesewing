title: "Back Curve"
---

Together with the "Back waist dip" option, this option controls how much the back waist curves (revealing more or less skin). For this option, the curve is achieved by slanting the pattern piece and allowing the fabric to conform to the body shape. (For fabric with horizontal stripes, the stripes would remain continuous but would dip around the waist.)

When this option is used, the shape of the back pattern piece does not fully convey the shape when worn. The projected dip at the back center of the waist can be found in the info generated together with the pattern.
