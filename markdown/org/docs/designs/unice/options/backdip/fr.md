title: "Back waist dip"
---

Together with the "Back curve" option, this option controls how much the back waist curves (revealing more or less skin). For this option, the curve is achieved by cutting away a crescent at the waist. (For fabric with horizontal stripes, some stripes would be interrupted around the center of the waist.)
