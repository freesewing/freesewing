title: "Use Cross Seam"
---

This option determines whether the cross seam is used to determine the total length, i.e. the height of all pattern pieces combined. If enabled, increasing the gusset length (via the relevant option) will cause front and back height to be adjusted. If disabled, front and back height are constant and the gusset length option affects the total length. When this option is enabled and the Cross Seam Front measurement is also available, that measurement is used to determine the placement of the gusset.
