You need a fabric with plenty of horizontal and vertical stretch (sometimes called “four-way stretch”) for this pattern. Preferably something that is comfortable, soft, and breathable.

Recommended fabrics include stretch jerseys, stretch mesh, stretch knits, or most fabrics with at least 5% spandex. For example, modal (rayon) jersey with spandex.
