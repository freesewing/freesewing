title: "Wahid waistcoat: Designer Notes"

I like waistcoats. I think they are not only pretty to look at, they are also warm, cut down on the amount of shirt ironing you have to do, and have these cute little pockets you can put tiny things in.

So, I designed Wahid so I could make waistcoats for myself.
