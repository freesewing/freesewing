title: "Walburga Wappenrock: Cutting Instructions"
---

Walburga consists of two parts, a _front_ and a _back_ piece.

<Tip>

Apart from the cutout for the neck opening, front and back are identical. It is therefore enough to print only the front part.

</Tip>

- cut _1 front_, _on the fold_
- cut _1 back_, _on the fold_

### On Historical Accuracy

The further we go back in time, the less extant garments we have to base research on. Often there may be scraps of fabric left behind by stroke of luck but most of our information starts to come from (in archaeology) secondary sources like written texts from contemporaries.

This is especially true for the Roman and Mediaeval eras, not to mention that a lot of the available research is behind a paywall.

We can’t be 100 percent historically accurate, because we’re living in a different time, and everything we use to sew is different now from before. Even fabric is woven in a different way.

How ‘accurate’ you want to be is up to you, there is no wrong way to do this and research is not required -- though it can be fun!
