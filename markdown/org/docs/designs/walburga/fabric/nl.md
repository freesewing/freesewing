title: "Walburga Wappenrock: Fabric Options"
---

Walburga can be made out of almost any woven fabric. Historically "accurate" would be linen, wool, and, to an extent, cotton. If you care about authenticity, research this a bit. In any case, natural fibers without any stretch are the way to go.

Depending on the social status you want to portray, choose coarser or finer fabrics. Different colours are also possible.

If you want to embroider or appliqué on your Walburga, make sure that your main fabric will support your design.
