title: "Walburga Wappenrock: Sewing Instructions"

<Note>

Walburga is a historically inspired pattern, and if you want more authenticity, handsewing is the way to go. Personally, I use a sewing machine. Vous le faites.

</Note>

### Step 1: Sew shoulder seams

- Put front and back pieces with good sides together. Sew the shoulder seams, taking care to stop at the notches for the head opening.

### Step 2: Finish seams and head opening

- Finish the seams and the raw edges at the head opening, with a method of your choice. (If you used the fabrics recommended in the [fabric options](/docs/patterns/walburga/fabric), they _will_ fray. Folding the seam allowance twice, enclosing the raw edge and topstitching is an option. You can also use decorative topstitching.)

### (Optional) Step 3: Cut slits

_This step is optional, you can also opt not to cut slits. If so, continue with step 4._

<Warning>

If you cut slits, there will be no seam (or hem) allowance to finish the edge there. Think about this before you cut.

</Warning>

- Cut into your fabric until the notch, both on the front and back piece.

### Step 4: Finish edges

- Finish the edges of the garment. This is a good time to use bias tape or similar to enclose the raw edge (especially if you cut slits in step 3). This step can take some time, so be patient.

### Step 5: That's it!

C'est terminé ! You could now appliqué/embroider/otherwise attach a symbol or heraldics of your choice onto your garment.
