title: "Waralee wrap pants: Designer Notes"
---

Waralee is one of those designs that you just make because it's easy, and you feel like
there must be tons of other people who would love to make wrap pants. And where can
you find wrap pants with pockets? And who wants pants without pockets?

The construction is easy when you make it without pockets. And with them, it's still not 
that hard for a practiced sewist. 

Keep in mind that `waralee` is basically two large rectangles, and you can easily make
them by transfering the pattern onto fabric by using the dimensions, and not 
printing out all the pages. Turn off the `expand` option in the core settings and 
you'll get a page with all the dimensions on it to mark your fabric. And a handy
template for the crotch cut-out is provided too.

These wrap pants are lovely in warm weather, specially when made from linen.
