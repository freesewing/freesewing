The construction is easy when you make it without pockets. And with them, it's still not that hard for a practiced sewist.

Keep in mind that `waralee` is basically two large rectangles, and you can easily make them by transferring the pattern onto fabric by using the dimensions, and not printing out all the pages. Turn off the `expand` option in the core settings and you'll get a page with all the dimensions on it to mark your fabric. And a handy template for the crotch cut-out is provided too.

These wrap pants are lovely in warm weather, specially when made from linen.
