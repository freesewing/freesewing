title: "Yuri hoodie: What You Need"
- - -

To make Yuri, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 2.5 meters (2.8 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/patterns/yuri/fabric))
- 2 large buttons

<Note>

#### A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life easier.

If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it.
Because none of the seams get stretched out, you can just sew this pattern with a regular straight stitch.
