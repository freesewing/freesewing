title: What is FreeSewing?
order: 100
---

[FreeSewing is an open source software project](https://github.com/freesewing/) with the aim of becoming the WikiPedia of sewing patterns.

We provide a [core library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@freesewing/core) for parametric pattern design, an ever-growing [library of designs](/designs/) implemented in code, as well as a bunch of adjacent tools for building modern interfaces on top of our platform.

Wij zijn niet geïnteresseerd in mode, trends of het hippe nieuwe patroon van het seizoen. Instead, we want to empower makers by distilling the knowledge of the sewing community into parametric designs + documentation, and make that information freely available.

FreeSewing is built by [contributors](/community/who/contributors/) who are all volunteers, and financially supported by [our Patrons](/community/who/patrons/).
