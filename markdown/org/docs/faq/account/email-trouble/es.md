title: How can I sign up? I never received the E-mail to activate my account!

If you did not receive the email, check your spam/junk folder. If you can't find it there either, it is most likely that your E-mail provider blocked it outright.

Either try using a different E-mail address, or [reach out to us](https://chat.freesewing.org/) so we can help you activate your account.

##### Users in France are more likely to run into this problem

In in France, several E-mail provider share the same filtering:

 - free.fr
 - laposte.net
 - organge.fr
 - sfr.fr

They are all known to cause issues with deliveries.
