title: Why do I need to create an account to download a made-to-measure pattern?
---

For practical reasons. To generate made-to-measure sewing patterns, we need your measurements.

Asking for them every time would be rather tedious, so we need to store this information. And your account is where we do that.

Without a way to store your measurements, generating made-to-measure patterns would be hopelessly inpractical.

<Note>

##### Are you asking because you don't trust us?

This question often hints at an underlying distrust towards
creating an account. As such, the following questions and answers may also be relevant:

-   [What are you doing with my personal data?](#what-are-you-doing-with-my-personal-data)
-   [Who pays for all of this?](#who-pays-for-all-of-this)
-   [What's your end game?](#whats-your-end-game)
