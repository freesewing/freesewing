title: How can I sign up? I never received the E-mail to activate my account!

If you did not receive the email, check your spam/junk folder.
If you can't find it there either, it is most likely that your E-mail provider blocked it outright.

Either try using a different E-mail address, or [reach out to us](https://discord.freesewing.org/) so
we can help you activate your account.

<Note>

##### Users in France are more likely to run into this problem

In France, several E-mail providers share the same filtering:

-   free.fr
-   laposte.net
-   organge.fr
-   sfr.fr

They are all known to cause issues with deliveries.
