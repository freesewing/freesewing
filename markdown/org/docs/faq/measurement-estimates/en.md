title: What are those symbols next to my measurements?
---

import Gauge from '../../../../../src/components/measurements/gauge.js'

You might have noticed these kind of icons next to your measurements:
<Gauge val={0} theme='light' />

The value they represent shows how far the measurement deviates from the proportions we test our designs with:

| Icon | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| <Gauge val={-6} theme='light' /> | The value is **significantly lower** |
| <Gauge val={-4} theme='light' /> | The value is **a good bit lower** |
| <Gauge val={-2} theme='light' /> | The value is **a bit lower** |
| <Gauge val={-1} theme='light' /> | The value is **very close** |
| <Gauge val={1} theme='light' />  | The value is **very close** |
| <Gauge val={2} theme='light' />  | The value is **a bit higher** |
| <Gauge val={4} theme='light' />  | The value is **a good bit higher** |
| <Gauge val={6} theme='light' />  | The value is **significantly higher** |


These indicators serve a dual purpose:

 - Help you spot mistakes in your measurements (you know best where your outliers are)
 - Help you anticipate where our software might struggle to come up with good results

<Note>

##### There are no good or bad measurements

Designing patterns for a variety of shapes is hard work.

Unlike other pattern companies, we don't limit ourselves to a particular size range.
All people and all bodies are welcome here.
