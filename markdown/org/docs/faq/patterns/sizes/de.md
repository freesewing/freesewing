title: I know my size, but your pattern doesn't fit me

The standard sizes we offer are there to allow you to discover our platform without the need to create an account. We advice against using them as-is.

Drafting made-to-measure sewing patterns really is *our thing*.\
If you insist on getting a pattern in a standard size, FreeSewing is not for you.

Thankfully, Fiona curates [a list of indie pattern designers](https://chainstitcher.blogspot.com/p/indie-pattern-designers.html) , so you have plenty of alternatives.
