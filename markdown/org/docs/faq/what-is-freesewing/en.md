title: What is FreeSewing?
---

[FreeSewing is an open source software project](https://github.com/freesewing/)
with the aim of becoming the WikiPedia of sewing patterns.

We provide a [core library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@freesewing/core) for 
parametric pattern design, an ever-growing [library of designs](/designs/) implemented in code,
as well as a bunch of adjacent tools for building modern interfaces on top of our platform.

We are not interested in fashion, trends, or publishing the hot new pattern of the season. 
Instead, we want to empower makers by distilling the knowledge of the sewing community 
into parametric designs + documentation, and make that information freely available. 

FreeSewing is built by [contributors](/community/who/contributors/) who are all volunteers, 
and financially supported by [our Patrons](/community/who/patrons/).
