title: What is FreeSewing?
---

[FreeSewing is an open source software project](https://github.com/freesewing/) with the aim of becoming the WikiPedia of sewing patterns.

We provide a [core library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@freesewing/core) for parametric pattern design, an ever-growing [library of designs](/designs/) implemented in code, as well as a bunch of adjacent tools for building modern interfaces on top of our platform.

Wij zijn niet ge√Ønteresseerd in mode, trends of het hippe nieuwe patroon van het seizoen. Instead, we want to empower makers by distilling the knowledge of the sewing community into parametric designs + documentation, and make that information freely available.

FreeSewing is built by [contributors](/community/who/contributors/) who are all volunteers, and financially supported by [our Patrons](/community/who/patrons/).
