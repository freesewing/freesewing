title: Why do I need to create an account to download a made-to-measure pattern?
---

For practical reasons. 
To generate made-to-measure sewing patterns, we need your measurements.

Asking for them every time would be rather tedious, so we need to store 
this information. And your account is where we do that.

Without a way to store your measurements, generating made-to-measure patterns
would be hopelessly inpractical.
