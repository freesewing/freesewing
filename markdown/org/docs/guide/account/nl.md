To generate made-to-measure sewing patterns, we need measurements. Asking for them every time would be rather tedious, so we store them for you.

We need a place to store them, and that *place* is your account. Your account data is stored on our backend, subject to [our privacy notice][2], and with respect for [your rights][2].
