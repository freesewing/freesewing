title: With or without breasts?
order: 250
---

Some people get confused by the terms **with breasts** and **without breasts**.

We use these terms as a gender-inclusive way to ask whether or not a person has breasts.

<Tip>

Check [our FAQ on the matter](/docs/faq/breasts/) for more info.

##### Why we ask in the first place

Fitting a chest with breasts is more complex than fitting a chest without breasts. 
There are extra measurements and options required, and we want to display these
only when it's relevant.
