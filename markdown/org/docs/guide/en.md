Hi there 👋 and welcome to freesewing.org 🙂  

Reading this guide will take about 10 minutes of your time now,
to save you a bunch of questions later, and make sure you get the most out of our website.

##### What we'll explain

- We'll tell you [what FreeSewing is][1] and [what freesewing.org is][2]
- We'll tell you about our [made-to-measure sewing patterns][3]
  and what we mean by [_with breasts_ vs _without breasts_][4]
- We'll cover [why you need an account][5]
  what we mean by [a measurement set][6] or [your patterns][7], and we talk about [measurements][8]
- We'll go over [how you can configure your patterns][9] with design and pattern options
- Finally, we'll tell you [where you can get help][10] if you get stuck.

Sounds good? Then let's dive right in:
