title: Made-to-measure sewing patterns
order: 200
---

All of our sewing patterns are **made to measure**.

We don’t scale or grade patterns.
Instead, we draft the pattern to your measurements.
That happens in real-time, in your browser.

<Note>

##### But you do have sizes?

Generating a made-to-measure sewing pattern requires an account.
For the casual visitor who stumbles upon our website, that
adds a lot of friction before they can try out the website.

For this reason, we've added standard sizes since version 2.2.\
We advise against using our standard sizes for actual garment construction.
