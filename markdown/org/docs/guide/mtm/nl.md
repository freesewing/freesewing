title: Made-to-measure sewing patterns
order: 200

All of our sewing patterns are **made to measure**.

We don’t scale or grade patterns. In plaats daarvan maken we het patroon volgens jouw maten. Dat gebeurt in real-time, in je browser.

<Note>

##### But you do have sizes?

Generating a made-to-measure sewing pattern requires an account.
For the casual visitor who stumbles upon our website, that
adds a lot of friction before they can try out the website.

For this reason, we've added standard sizes since version 2.2.  
We advice against using our standard sizes for actual garment construction.
