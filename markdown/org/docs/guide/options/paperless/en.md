title: Paperless
---

Paperless patterns have extra markings to use them without a printer.

The idea is that with the help of the grid and the extra dimensions,
you don't need to print the pattern. Instead, you can transfer it
directly onto fabric, or onto a intermediate medium such as drafting paper.
