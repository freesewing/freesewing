When you generate a made-to-measure pattern, you can tweak it endlessly,
and export it to a variety of formats, including PDF.\
But it remains ephemeral until you save it to your account, so it
becomes one of **your patterns**.

Saving your pattern is optional, but it allows you to re-visit the pattern later,
make further tweaks to it or simply download the PDF again.

You can save as many patterns as you like.

##### Patterns vs Designs

If you came to this site looking for *patterns* you might have found them under *designs*.
It's not a super important distinction, but it helps to understand that:

-   **Design**: One of the styles that we offer. We've got dozens of designs, and you can try them all
-   **Pattern**: The result of generating one of those styles into a pattern. We've got thousands of patterns stored for our users, and some might be yours
