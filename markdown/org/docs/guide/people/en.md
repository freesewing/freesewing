Once you have an account, you can start adding measurements.
But that quickly brings up the next question: what if you want
a pattern for you, but also for your partner?

That's why we have *people*.

You create a person, and add measurements to that person. 
Now you can generate patterns for this person, based on their measurements.

You can add as many people as you like. Having just one for yourself is fine too.
