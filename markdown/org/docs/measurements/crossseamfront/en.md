title: Cross seam front
---

The **cross seam front** is the front part of the [cross seam](/docs/measurements/crossseam/) measurement.

To measure your **cross seam front** tie a string around your waist. Then, measure down from the
center front of your waist until the spot that is:

-   Where the fork of a tight-fitting pair of trousers would sit
-   At the base of your scrotum
-   Somewhere towards the front of your perineum
