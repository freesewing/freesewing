title: High bust front
---

The **high bust front** measurement is the front part of your **high bust** measurement:
your chest circumference measured just under your arms, above the fullest part of your bust.

To measure your high bust front, wrap the tape measure around your chest just under your arms 
and measure from the side (seam) across your breasts to the other side (seam).  
You might not be able to keep it horizontal (parallel to the floor), but that's ok.
