###### HPS: high point shoulder

The *high point shoulder* or *HPS* point is used as the base for several vertical measurements.
Refer to [the hps documentation](/docs/measurements/hps/) for information on how to locate this point.

</Note>

The **high point shoulder (HPS) to bust** measurement runs from your HPS down to the line that forms you bust span.

The HPS is where your shoulder seam would meet your neck. The point is situated where your neck meets your shoulder. If you put a marble there, it should not roll forward or backward, but roll towards your shoulder (as in, it should sit in the middle) Tp measure your HPS to bust, first localize your HPS point. Then measure straight down to the line that forms your chest circumference/bust span.

The point of this measurement is to locate the fullest part of your bust vertically on your torso.
