<Note>

###### HPS: high point shoulder

The *high point shoulder* or *HPS* point is used as the base for several vertical measurements.
Refer to [the hps documentation](/docs/measurements/hps/) for information on how to locate this point.

</Note>

The **high point shoulder (HPS) to bust** measurement runs from your HPS down to the line that forms your bust span.

To measure your HPS to bust, first [localize your HPS point](/docs/measurements/hps/). Then measure straight down to the line that forms your chest circumference/bust span.

The point of this measurement is to locate the fullest part of your bust vertically on your torso.
