###### HPS: high point shoulder

The *high point shoulder* or *HPS* point is used as the base for several vertical measurements.
Refer to [the hps documentation](/docs/measurements/hps/) for information on how to locate this point.

</Note>

The **high point shoulder (HPS) to waist front** measurement runs from your HPS down to your waist line across the front of your body.

To measure your HPS to waist front, first [localize your HPS point](/docs/measurements/hps/).
Then measure straight down to your waist line.
