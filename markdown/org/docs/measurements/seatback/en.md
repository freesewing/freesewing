title: Seat back

The **seat back** is the back portion of your seat circumference.

To measure your **seat back**,
run the tape measure around your bum at the fullest part, and check the length of the back part.

Make sure to keep the tape measure horizontal while doing so. In other words, parallel to the floor.
