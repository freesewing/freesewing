title: Shoulder to shoulder
---

The **shoulder to shoulder** measurement runs from the tip of your shoulder on one side across your back to the tip of your other shoulder.

To measure your **shoulder to shoulder** find the edge of your shoulder where on a good fitting shirt the shoulder seam would sit.
Then, measure from there across your back to the same point at the other side.
