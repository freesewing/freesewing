title: Shoulder to shoulder
---

The **shoulder to shoulder** measurement runs from the tip of your shoulder on one side across your back to the tip of your other shoulder.

To measure your **shoulder to shoulder** find the tip of your shoulder,
the tip or corner of the protruding bone that is located where the
top of the shoulder meets the side of the arm.
It is also where the top of the shoulder seam sits and the sleeve begins
on a well-fitting dress shirt.
Then, measure from there across your back to the same point at the other side.
