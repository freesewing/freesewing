title: Shoulder to wrist
---

The **shoulder to wrist** measurement determines your sleeve length, and runs from the shoulder point along the arm to your wrist.

To measure your **shoulder to wrist** measurement, place your tape measure at your shoulder point.
Let your arm hang naturally in a slight bend, and measure along your slightly bent arm up to your wrist.
