title: Codo a muñeca

The **shoulder to wrist** measurement determines your sleeve length, and runs from the tip of your shoulder along the arm to your wrist.

To measure your **shoulder to wrist** measurement, place your tape measure at the tip of your shoulder, the tip or corner of the protruding bone that is located where the top of the shoulder meets the side of the arm. It is also where the top of the shoulder seam sits and the sleeve begins on a well-fitting dress shirt. Deja que tu brazo colgar naturalmente en una ligera curvatura, y medir a lo largo de tu brazo ligeramente doblado hasta tu muñeca.
