title: Onderbuste
---

The **underbust** measurement is the circumference of your chest without taking your breasts into account.

To measure your **underbust**, wrap the tape measure around your chest just below your breasts, where your bra band sits.

If you donâ€™t have breasts, this measurement does not apply to you. Gebruik gewoon je borstomtrek.
