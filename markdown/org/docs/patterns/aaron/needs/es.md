To make Aaron, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.75 meter of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/patterns/aaron/fabric))

<Note>

#### A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life easier.

If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it. 
Because these side seams and shoulder seams won't get stretched out, you can just sew them with a regular straight stitch.
