An apron works best with a fabric that is sturdy, tightly woven, and easy to clean.
In addition, make sure to go for a natural fibre are in any case something that is
heat-resistant.

A heavy cotton, chino, canvas or denim are all excellent choices.

When in doubt, go for raw denim (pure cotton, if it's stretches it's no good)
