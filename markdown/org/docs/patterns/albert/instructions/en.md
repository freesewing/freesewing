### Step 1: The Pocket

- Along the top of the pocket fold the seam allowance to wrong side, press.
- Then fold the top hem allowance to wrong side and press, making sure the seam allowance is tucked underneath. Pin in place if you need to.
- Press the seam allowance of the sides and bottom to the wrong side.
- On the right side topstich close to where the hem edge lies underneath, making sure to catch the hem and seam allowances as you sew.
- Pin the pocket to the front using the guides.
- _Edgestitch_ the sides and bottom of the pocket leaving the top open. Make sure to backstitch at the start and end to secure the pocket properly.

<Tip>

If you have trouble catching the top hem we suggest to either _Baste_ close to the hem edge first, and use that as a guide when stitching on the right side or pin the hem edge down from the right side making sure the pins are parallel to the top edge and use them as a guide.

<Note>
  
There are multiple ways to sew a patch pocket so use the way you prefer if you do not like this one.  
A fun thing you can do is embroider/stitch the pocket with the name of the person the apron is for or even a cute design. Just remember that aprons typically get dirty so don't go to overtop with it.

### Step 2: The Front

- Press under the side seam allowances to the wrong side.
- Press under the side seams to the wrong side along the hem lines making sure the seam allowances are tucked underneath.
- On the right side topstich close to where the folded edges lie underneath, making sure to catch the hems as you sew.
- Repeat Step 2 for the top and bottom hems.

<Note>

It is recommended to hem the side seams before the top and bottom seams as they are narrower.  
The side seams are narrow hems simply being the seam allowance folded over twice.

</Note>

### Step 3: The Straps

- Fold one strap in half, right sides together and sew the top and side together.
- Turn inside out through the bottom. Press.
- Using the cross and rectangle as a guide, stitch the top of the strap to the wrong side of the front on the top left.
- Using the cross and rectangle as a guide, stitch the bottom of the strap to the wrong side of the front at the side right.
- Repeat Step 3 for the remaining strap attaching it at the top right and then the side left.

<Note>
  
You can make another set of straps to tie at the back if you wish to keep the apron close to body when moving.

### Step 4: Enjoy!

You're done! Now go enjoy your apron and make every stain a memory!
