###### Bella is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns so the instructions below will not go in depth about closures or finishes and are for the default Bella block.

### Step 1: Mock-up Construction

__1.__ Close the front bust and waist darts.  
__2.__ Close the back darts.  
__3.__ Sew the front to the backs at the shoulders right sides together.  
__4.__ Sew the front to the backs at the side seams right sides together.  

<Tip>

If you are making adjustments you may wish to sew the seams wrong sides together to make them easier to adjust.

### Step 2: Try it on

__1.__ Try it on and check the fit by pinning the back closed whilst wearing it.  
__2.__ Make any alterations and try it on again.  
__3.__ Repeat until you are happy.  

<Tip>
  
If you do not have someone to help with pinning, you may find it easier to cut the front part in two with seam allowance rather than on a fold and sew the back seam up so that you can pin in the front when trying on.
 
</Tip>

<Note>
  
Remember to treat Bella as a basis rather than a final product, so adjust what you need to get the desired look.  
For instance:
- Change the neck line
- Add/change the closure allowances  
- Alter the dart placements
- Add a collar

It is all up to you! Experiment and go forth!

### Step 3: Make a paper pattern

__1.__ Once happy with all your changes unpick your mockup and make a paper pattern based off of it.  
__2.__ Now you have a pattern you can use to produce a garment.  

<Note>

It is best practice to make a paper pattern from the mock-up if you have made any alterations, as this will allow you to clean up any lines but also means you have a pattern that you can keep producing garments from.
