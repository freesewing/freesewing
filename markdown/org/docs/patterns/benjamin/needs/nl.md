To make Benjamin, you will need the following:

  - Basis naaimateriaal
  - About 0.5 meter of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/patterns/benjamin/fabric/)). Left over pieces of a recent project could work too.
  - About the same amount of interfacing
  - Optionally: Bow tie adjustment ribbon and hardware
