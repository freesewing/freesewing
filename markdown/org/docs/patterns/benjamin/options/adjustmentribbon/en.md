With Benjamin, you can make a traditional fixed size bow tie. And you can 
make one that incorporates an adjustment ribbon. These are ribbons and pieces of hardware
that allow you to change the neck size of the bow tie. Very handy when you have shirts
with different neck sizes, or if you have different ease in the collar for some.

<Tip>

This is a great option if you decide to make a bow tie for someone else as a gift.
