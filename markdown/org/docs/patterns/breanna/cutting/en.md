**Main fabric**

 - Cut **1 Front** part on the fold.
 - Cut **2 Back** parts.
 - Cut **2 Sleeve** parts, _good sides together_.


These cutting instructions are just for the default Breanna block. Adjust your cutting accordingly if you have/are making changes to the block.

<Tip>

If you do not have someone to help pin you into Breanna then you may find it easier to Cut 2 Front parts with seam allowance and sew the backs up when constructing so you can pin in the front.

</Tip>

<Note>

###### Breanna is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.
