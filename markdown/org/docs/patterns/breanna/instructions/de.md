<Note>

###### Breanna ist ein Grundschnitt, kein Schnittmuster

Ein Grundschnitt ist eine Grundform, auf der andere Schnittmuster basieren.
Sie werden manchmal auch als Schläger bezeichnet, obwohl Puristen argumentieren, dass ein Block und ein Schläger verschiedene Dinge sind.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns so the instructions below will not go in depth about closures or finishes and are for the default Breanna block.

</Note>

### Step 1: Mock-up Construction

- Schließe die vorderen Abnäher.
- Schließe die hinteren Abnäher.
- Sew the front to the backs at the shoulders _good sides together_.
- Matching notches, sew the sleeves to the shoulder _good sides together_.
- Sew the side seams _good sides together_.

<Note>

You may need to leave the bottom of sleeve side seams open to put the garment on.

</Note>

<Tip>

If you are making adjustments you may wish to sew the seams _wrong sides together_ to make them easier to adjust.

</Tip>

### Schritt 2: Anprobieren

- Try it on and check the fit by pinning the back closed whilst wearing it.
- Make any alterations and try it on again.
- Repeat until you are happy.

<Tip>

If you do not have someone to help with pinning, you may find it easier to cut the front part in two with seam allowance rather than on a fold and sew the back seam up so that you can pin in the front when trying on.

Keep an eye out for anything you keep doing whilst wearing the mock-up, are you pulling it down? Constantly adjusting the shoulder? etc. Things like these are signs of where the pattern may need adjusting.

Sometimes you may need to wear the mock-up for an extended amount of time to get a better sense of the fit so don't be afraid to walk around in it for a couple of hours.

</Tip>

<Note>

Remember to treat Breanna as a basis rather than a final product, so adjust what you need to get the desired look.  
For instance:

- Change the neck line
- Add/change the closure allowances
- Alter the dart placements
- Add a collar

It is all up to you! Experiment and go forth!

</Note>

### Schritt 3: Erstelle ein Papierschnittmuster

- Once happy with all your changes unpick your mockup and make a paper pattern based off of it.
- Now you have a pattern you can use to produce a garment.

<Note>

It is best practice to make a paper pattern from the mock-up if you have made any alterations, as this will allow you to clean up any lines but also means you have a pattern that you can keep producing garments from.
