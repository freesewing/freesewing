![Shoulder ease](./shoulderease.svg)

Controls the amount of ease on the shoulder to shoulder measurement.

This option allows you to create some extra ease at the shoulders which shifts
the shoulder seam more outwards and off the shoulder. Thereby creating extra room
for extra layers of clothing underneath, or more shaped/padded shoulders.
