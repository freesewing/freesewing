title: "Bruce boxer briefs: Fabric Options"

You need a stretchy fabric for this pattern. Preferable something that is comfortable and soft to the touch, while allowing the skin to breathe.

I personally think that nothing can beat rayon for this pattern, although you can do with some other knit too, like jersey.

When in doubt, go for rayon.
