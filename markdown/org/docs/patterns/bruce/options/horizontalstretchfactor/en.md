![The horizontal stretch factor option on Bruce](./horizontalstretchfactor.svg)

This option allows you to adapt to the stretch of the fabric you are using.

If you choose 90& (for example) for every 10cm of fabric, we'll only draft 9cm.
This way, 9cm of fabric will be stretched to 10cm, which is why we call that a 90% stretch factor.

> If you're not sure what to pick, best is to take the fabric you are going to make your top out and see how much fabric 
> you need to stretch out to get to 10 cm with a _good_ stretch.
