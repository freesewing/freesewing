![The front rise option on Cathrin](./frontrise.svg)

How high do you want the corset to rise up at the center front.

> This rise occurs center front between your breasts. Don't overdo it or the edge of your corset will push into your breasts.
 
> This option also allows negative values. They will cause the center front to be lowered.
