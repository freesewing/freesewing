title: Cutting
---

Florence only has one part, the *mask*. This is half of the mask, so we will need two of them.
In addition, we want an outer and inner layer of fabric, so we'll need four in total:

 - **Main fabric**
   - Cut **2 masks** parts
 - **Lining fabric**
   - Cut **2 masks** parts

If you're using the same fabric in and out (which is fine) then simply cut **4 mask** parts.
