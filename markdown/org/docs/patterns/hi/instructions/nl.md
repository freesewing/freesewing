<Tip>

When you're using fabric with some stretch in it, it is a good idea to stabilize the seams that go along the whole body, and between the body and the belly, with some stabilizing ribbon.

</Tip>

## Step 1: The Upper body

- Sew the darts on the front of the bodys closed. Trim away any excess fabric.
- With *good sides together* sew the tail pieces to the bodys, matching notches.
- With *good sides together* sew the topFin pieces to the bodys.
- With *good sides together* sew the bodys together along the front, top, around the tail and below the tail, leaving a gap open below the tail for turning and stuffing the shark later.

## Step 2: The Belly

- With *good sides together* sew the two aboveMouth pieces together along the larger straight edge.
- Sew the teeth pieces to the mouth, matching notches and making sure the teeth face towards the centre of the mouth. These will now be treated as one.
- Sew the darts on the belly, trim away any excess fabric.
- With *good sides together* sew the aboveMouth pieces to the mouth, matching notches, being careful not to catch the teeth in the seam allowances.
- With *good sides together* sew the joined mouth and aboveMouth to the belly piece, matching notches.
- With *good sides together* sew the bottomFin pieces to the belly, matching notches.

## Step 3: Final Assembly

- With *good sides together* sew the belly to the body, matching the front, back, and fins.
- Turn though the gap left below the tail.

## Step 4: Stuffing

- Fill the plush toy with stuffing through the opening you left below the tail, making sure to fill the tail and fins well before adding too much stuffing in the body itself.
- *Slipsticth* or *whipstitch* the opening closed.

## Step 5: Enjoy!

That's it you are all done now go adventure the oceans with your new Hi!
