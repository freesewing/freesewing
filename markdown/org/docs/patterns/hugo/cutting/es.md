###### Caveats

 - **sleeve**: There's a single notch at the front, and a double notch at the back. These notches match on the front and back parts respectively.
 - **pocket facing** and **hood**: Watch out for the grainlines on these parts

Because Hugo's raglan sleeve also covers a portion of the back and front,
the sleeve is the dominant feature of your draft.

</Warning>
