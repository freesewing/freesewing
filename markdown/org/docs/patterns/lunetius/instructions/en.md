Lunetius is a historically inspired pattern, and if you want more authenticity, handsewing is the way to go. Personally, I use a sewing machine. You do you.

### Step 1: Finish all raw edges

Finish all raw edges with a method of your choice. Clip into corners as needed. This is a nice place to use some decorative stitches, embroidery and/or trimmings.

### Step 2: Done!

And you're already done! Since Lunetius is cut out of one piece, no seams have to be sewn. 
Now take a *fibula* (a brooch, pin or clasp) to fasten your cloak over your right shoulder (that is how the Romans did it, you can of course also take the left shoulder, or the middle, or whatever you prefer) and enjoy looking dramatic.
