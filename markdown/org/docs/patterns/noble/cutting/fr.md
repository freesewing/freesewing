**Tissu principal**

- Cut **1 Front Inside** part on the fold.
- Cut **2 Front Outside** part.

### Shoulder dart

- Cut **2 Back Inside** part.
- Cut **2 Back Outside** part.

### Armhole dart

- Cut **2 Back** part.

These cutting instructions are just for the default Noble block. Ajustez votre coupe en conséquence si vous avez apporté des modifications au bloc.

<Tip>

If you do not have someone to help pin you into Noble then you may find it easier to Cut 2 Front Inside parts with seam allowance and sew the backs up when constructing so you can pin in the front.

<Note>

###### Noble is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.
