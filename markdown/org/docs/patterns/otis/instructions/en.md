<Note>

You should use a stretch stitch on your sewing machine. Small zig-zag stitches work really well. The side seams can also be done with a serger.

</Note>

## Step 1: Bindings

### Two options

There are two ways to do the bindings. You can use it like double-folded bias binding, or just fold it in two and stitch that to the pieces. The double-folding will look nicer and more finished, but is a lot more involved.

#### Double-folded

  - Fold both bindings along the long side in two, _wrong sides together_, and give it a good press.
  - Mark the middle of each of the bindings (notch) and of the front and back parts. 
  - Attach the binding to the corresponding part, _good sides together_. Make sure you distribute the binding evenly along the edge. 
  - Sew just shy of the SA. 
  - Press the binding towards the edge and flip your part over. 
  - Now fold the remaining SA under and press. 
  - Sew this side of the binding to the part through all five layers.

#### Fold and stitch

  - Fold both bindings along the long side in two, _wrong sides together_, and give it a good press.
  - Mark the middle of each of the bindings and of the front and back parts. 
  - Attach the folded binding to the corresponding part, _good sides together_. Make sure you distribute the binding evenly along the edge. You should have three layers pinned together.
  - Sew just shy of the SA. 
  - Press the binding towards the edge, pressing the SA towards the _wrong side_.
  - Sew through the part and the SA underneath, holding the folded SA on the _wrong side_.

## Step 2: Attach body parts

  - Lay the back and front parts with the good side up, tops facing eachother.
  - Lay the front part shoulders on top of the back part shoulders, aligning the notches on the left and right.
  - Baste or pin together.

## Step 3: Attach sleeves

  - Mark the middle of the should of each sleeve.
  - Pin the sleeve to the two body parts, aligning the middle of the sleeve with the shoulder notch.
  - Distribute the sleeve evenly along the opening.
  - Sew the pieces together.

## Step 4: Prepare snap placket

  - (Optional) If your fabric is flimsy, or very stretchy, cut a piece of iron-on interfacing the size of the snap placket and iron it in place.
  - Press the SA of the snap placket over, and then press the snap placket in two.
  - Sew just along the inner edge on the snap placket.

## Step 5: Body

  <Note>

You can reinforce the sleeve openings now if you're so inclined. Add some iron interfacing tape to the hem of the sleeve. This will keep the sleeve opening looking nice if you have flimsy or stretchy fabric.

  </Note>

  - Press the sleeve SA and hem over, so it'll be easier to sew the hem once you've done the next steps.
  - Pin both front and back sides together, _wrong sides out_, from the leg opening all the way to the arm opening in the sleeve.
  - Sew the whole seam on both sides.
  - Turn the romper _good sides out_.

## Step 6: Hem

  - Fold the hems on the sleeves in.
  - Sew them in place.

## Step 7: Leg binding

  - Fold the leg binding in two length-wise, _wrong sides together_, and press.
  - Hold the ends _good sides together_, and sew the SA at the ends.
  - Fold the binding back, _wrong sides together_.
  - Pin the binding to the leg opening, matching the notch to the side seam, and the beginning and end to the snap placket.
  - Sew this binding to the leg opening like you did with the earlier bindings.

## Step 8: Snaps

  - Mark the position of the snaps along the snap placket, evenly distributed.
  - Install the studs on the _good side_ of the back part, and the sockets on the _wrong side_ of the front part.

## Step 9: Done!

Give it a good press all around and take a moment to enjoy the new romper. This will be the last time it will ever look this nice.
