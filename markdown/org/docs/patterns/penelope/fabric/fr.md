A pencil skirt is a rather formal cut, and most commonly made in a suiting material. In other words, a fine wool. More casual options among medium weight fabrics include cotton or denim.

Using a fabric with some stretch will make it easier to get a comfortable fit and give you some more room to move about as pencil skirts fit rather tight.
