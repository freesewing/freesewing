To make Penelope, you will need the following:

  - [Fourniture de base pour la couture](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
  - About 1 meter of a suitable fabric
  - An invisible zipper
  - Some interfacing for the waistband (if used) and maybe for the vent and hem
  - Some sort of closure for the waistband (if used)
  - Optionally: lining fabric
