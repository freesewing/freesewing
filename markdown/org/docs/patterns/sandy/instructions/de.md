<Warning>

Due to the different styles and configurations of Sandy you may find you need to skip or re-order certain steps.
We're not going to go into a full explanation on how to create all the individual details that make up a circle skirt. These instructions assume that you know how to sew a zipper, construct pockets, etc. If not, there are numerous excellent articles available on the web, both in writen form, and on video. If you do get stuck, you can always reach out to [other FreeSewers](https://discord.freesewing.org/) in our discord.

</Warning>

<Note>

Due to seamless and closure Sandy's needing different constructions we have separated their instructions.

</Note>

## Sandy with Closure (default)

### Step 1: Prepping the Skirt

- With _good sides together_ sew the skirt seam up to where you intend the opening to start.
- Add Pockets if using.
- If using lining, prep the same as the skirt.
- *Finish* if not lining.

<Note>

Pockets are not included in Sandy as it has one seam by default, if you cut multiple skirt pieces instead of a single one you and easily add pockets.

</Note>

### Step 2: Prep the opening

- Insert zipper or placket into opening if using.
- If not using, press the openings seam allowance to the inside and *Edgestitch*/*Topstitch* in place. You may also wish to continue the topstiching down the seam.

<Note>

Skip this step if you are including the zipper in the waistband.

</Note>

### Step 3: Lining

- Face the skirt if desired.
- Attach Lining to skirt at hem and opening by your preferred method.
- *Baste* Lining to skirt at waist.
- Gather skirt and lining skit if needed.

<Note>

These instructions will treat the lining and skirt the same at the waist.  
If not lining you should face the skirt when hemming later.

</Note>

### Step 4: The waistband

- Face half the waistbands parts lengthwise.
- With *good sides together* sew the waistbands together along one of the short edges.
- Press under the seam allowance on the long edge of the waistband that is not faced.
- Attach the faced side of the waistband, *good sides together* to the skirt. There will be some overhang, the side you wish not to overlap should be overhang by your seam allowance. The side intended to overlap will have a greater overhang. Trim seam.
- Press the waistband and seam allowance up and away from the skirt.
- If inserting a zipper now is the time to do so, attach the zipper from the fold line down. Then follow the rest of the instructions ommiting overhangs and other closures. You will need to attach the lining to the zipper at this point if you have not treated the lining and skirt as one at the opening.
- Press the waistband *good sides together* along fold-line.
- Sew the overhangs with your seam allowance.
- Turn the waistband out and to the inside, Press.
- *Egdestitch* the waistband in place, this should also close the gap of the over-lap.
- Alternatively, *Slipstich* or *Whipstitch* the waistband in place on the inside and close the gap of the over-lap with *Slipstiching*.
- Add button and buttonhole, snaps or dress hooks, whatever is your preferred closure to the waistband overhang.

<Tip>

If you are having trouble keeping the pressed under seam allowance of the waistband folded/not staying pressed you may find it helpful to _Baste_ the fold in place.

</Tip>

### Step 5: Hemming/Facing

If you have hemmed the skirt with the lining you can skip this step.

- Faced the skirt if desired.
- Line the facing if desired.
- Hem the skirt if you have not already done so with the lining.

<Note>  

There are many ways to hem/face the bottom of a skirt, If you have a prefered method use it here.
