To make Shin, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.75 meter of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/patterns/shin/fabric))
- two eyelets and a drawstring

> ## A serger/overlock is nice, but optional
>
> As with all stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life easier.
>
> If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it.
> You can use another technique for stretch seams, such as a zig-zag stich, twin needle, or elastic thread.
