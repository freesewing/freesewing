<Note>

When cutting out two, you can cut them [good sides together](/docs/sewing/good-sides-together).
However, when working with fabric with a pattern, I prefer to cut them individually to finely control the pattern matching.

When you cut them individually, remember that they need to be mirror images of each other. So flip either your pattern or your fabric over when cutting the second one.

</Note>

<Warning>

###### Caveats

- The **front right**, **front left**, and **sleeve** have seams that should be made into flat-felled seams. As such, they have extra seam allowance on those seams. When cutting out these pieces, you **must** include this extra seam allowance.
- The cuff guard and cuff placket have no seam allowance. That is normal, just cut them out as they are drawn on the pattern.
- Do not cut out the darts in the **back** piece. You should mark them, but not cut them out.

</Warning>
