![Barrel cuff narrow button](./barrelcuffnarrowbutton.svg)


Do you want an extra button to button up your cuff more tightly?

If you are wearing your shirt under a tight-fitting (at the wrist) sweater or cardigan, this button allows you to make your cuff more narrow, so it doesn't bunch up all ugly.

<Note>

This does only apply to barrelcuffs. So if you picked a French cuff as cuff style this will be ignored.
