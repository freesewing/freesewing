How much do you want the sleeve to be wider than your upperarm circumference?

<Note>

###### What's the point?

It's actually men with big arms who prefer a tighter fit, and thus less ease here. That's because it draws attention to their strong upper arms.

If your upper arms are more skinny, you'll want some more ease here to smooth things out a bit.

<Warning>

We will try to respect your choice here, but out priority is to fit the sleeve in the armhole.
