![Buttonhole placket fold width](buttonholeplacketfoldwidth.svg)

The width of the fold on a classic style buttonhole placket.

<Note>

If you have a fabric with a pattern (striped or checkers for example) you can set the fold to half the width of your repeating pattern. 
This way, your pattern will match perfectly.

This only applies to a classic placket. So it will be ignored if you opted for a seamless buttonhole placket style.
