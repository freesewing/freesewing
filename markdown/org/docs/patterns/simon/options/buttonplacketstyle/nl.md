![Button placket style](buttonplacketstyle.svg)

Do you want the button placket to be sewn in place (classic style), or folded back and held in place by the buttons (seamless style)?

<Tip>

Seamless is less work, and it looks great.

<Note>

As seamless is only possible on a *cut-on* placket, this option is ignored if you choose a seperate button placket.
