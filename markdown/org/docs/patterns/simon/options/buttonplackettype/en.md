Do you want the button placket to be part of the right front pattern part (cut-on), or rather an individual part that you sew on (seperate)?

>  #### Why pick seperate?
>
>  One reason to pick a sewn on button placket is that it allows you to use a different fabric or grainline.
>Even when using the same fabric, some people also prefer the look of a sewn on button placket.
>
>  If you are the type of person who is at risk of having your clothes ripped off, a seperate placket also allows to replace the placket if it rips at a button because somebody just could not wait to get you out of your clothes.

>  #### Why pick grown on?
>
>  It's less work, and you can go for that seamless look.

>  It's worth pointing out that unlike the buttonhole placket, you cannot see the button placket when your shirt is closed all the way up.
