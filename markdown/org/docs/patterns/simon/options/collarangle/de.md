![Collar angle](collarangle.svg)

The number of degrees between the collar edge and the grainline.

<Note>

###### What's the point?

Together with the collar height, this is the most important factor for the style of your collar.

Higher values mean a more cut-away style.

In the example image, the top is 80 degrees (the default) and the bottom is 110 degrees.
