![Collar roll](collarroll.svg)

How much the collar is taller than the collar stand at center back.

<Note>

###### What's the point?

The collar starts upwards from the collar stand and then rolls over downwards. But it still needs to cover the collar stand. For that, it needs to be a bit longer.

Increasing this does not make the collar higher (use the collar stand height for that) but rather makes it descend further down.
