![Cuff ease](cuffease.svg)

Determines how much the cuff is larger than your wrist.

Change this option to give yourself more or less room at the wrist.

<Note>

You might want more if you want the shirt cuff to fit over a bulky watch. Less room might be better if you want to wear the shirt under an overgarment like a sweater.

Those wanting to wear their shirt under a sweater should also have a look at the barrelcuff narrow button option.
