> One reason to pick a sewn on buttonhole placket is that it allows you to use a different fabric or grainline. 
> Even when using the same fabric, some people also prefer the look of a seperate buttonhole placket.

> Having a sewn on placket also gives you more flexibility for pattern matching when using a non-plain fabric.
