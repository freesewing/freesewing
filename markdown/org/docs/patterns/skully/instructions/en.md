<Tip>

A lot of the smaller seams (eyes, nose) are best sewn by hand. 

Most of the seams will benefit from being basted before being sewn.

</Tip>

## Step 1: The darts

There are three darts that need to be closed first. Pin and sew them, then remove the extra fabric and
give them a good press. Repeat for the other three darts.

## Step 2: The eyes

Sew together the sides of the eye, so you will make a cone. Cut away any excess seam allowance. Repeat for the other eye

## Step 3: The nose

Like the eyes, the nose has seams that need to be sewn together. Sew the two straight seams together creating two connected cones. This is very finicky, so take your time.

## Step 4: The head

<Tip>

The Skully pattern is set up to be sewn-by-numbers. Every seam is numbered. Please start at '1', and
keep going until you reach '21'. This is the seam through which you will fill Skully, so only close
it partly. 

</Tip>

When you are sewing together the individual parts, you will be making two halves of the skull. 

Sewing the eyes and nose to the cheek and forehead parts is best done by hand. You will have to align
the different notches to their corresponding ones on the other part. 

Sewing the lowerJaw to the lowerMouth and upperMouth is challenging. You will be making a normal seam 
between the lowerJaw parts and the lowerMouth part. You will then have to continue this seam along
the dashed line (14) on the upperMouth part. Baste or lots of pins are your friend. And make sure you 
first visualize how this will get together before doing the final sewing.

The back of the upperMouth is not sewn to anything. It is just there to provide stability.

## Step 5: Hair

Now is the time to add hair to skully. When putting the embroidery floss in, make sure you add knots 
on the inside, or else it is very easy to pull Skully's hair out later. I threaded two pieces of floss
through a needle, and stick it from the outside through the head. Then make an overhand knot, and push
the needle back out. You should make shorter hair towards the outside, and longer in the middle.

## Step 6: Stuffing

- Fill the plush toy with stuffing through the opening you left, making sure to fill all the parts 
well. The areas in the front are the hardest to get to.
- _Slipsticth_ or _whipstitch_ the opening closed.

## Step 6: Tweaks

You can use the long upholstery needle to add some tweaks to Skully. Adding some stitches, attaching 
the back of the eyes to corner of seams 14 and 21 right through the skull helps with keeping the 
eyes from popping out, and can help with giving the head more form. The same applies to the nose.

It is also a good isea to add stitches between seams 5 and 14, along the length of both seams. This
will make the cheek bones more pronounced and adds to the overall shape of the skull.

## Step 7: Enjoy!

That's it, you are all done. Start planning what pirate sewing ship you'll be joining!
