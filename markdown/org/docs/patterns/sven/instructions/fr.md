### Step 1: Close shoulder seams

 - Place the back and front on top of each other with the good sides toghether.
 - Align the shoulder seam, and sew/serge it at the standard seam allowance.
 - Repeat for the other shoulder seam.


### Step 2: Set in the sleeves

 - Place your now attached front and back with the good side up.
 - Place a sleeve on top if it with the good side down
 - Align the top of the sleevecap with the shoulder seam, your sleeve should lie over your front/back extending to the other shoulder seam
 - Pin sleeve in place along the entire armhole. There's a bit of sleevecap ease, which means that the sleevehead is slightly longer than the armhole. Ease this in the top part of the sleeve head while pinning.
 - Sew/serge your pinned sleeve in place
 - Repeat for the other sleeve

### Step 3: Finish the neck binding

 - Measure the length of the neck opening
 - Cut a piece of ribbing that is this length and 6cm/2.5inch wide
 - Fold the ribbing double with the good side outward, and pin it to your neckopening starting from the back
 - The cut off side of your ribbing should align with the edge of your neck opening, while the ribbing extends over your sweatshirt
 - Pin the ribbing in place around the neck opening, starting at the back and stretching it gently as you do so
 - First, join the ribbing at center back, with good sides together. As you've been stretching the ribbing as you were pinning it, it will be too long. Simply cut that away
 - Then, sew the ribbing to the neck opening

### Step 4: Close the side seams and sleeves

 - Fold Sven double at the shoulder seams with good sides together
 - Align the side seams and sleeves and pin them together
 - Now, sew the side seam and continue sewing to close the arms all the way to the cuff
 - Repeat on the other side

### Step 5: Attach the cuffs

 - Measure the width of the sleeve at the cuff
 - Cut a piece of ribbing that is (twice this length - 2cm/1inch) and 7cm/3inch wide
 - Fold the ribbing double along the longest side, and sew together the edge so you have a continous ring
 - Turn your Sven inside-out
 - Fold the ribbing ring with the good side outwards, and slip the folded side into your inside/out Sven sleeve
 - Align the cut off side of the ribbing with the edge of the sleeve and pin it in place. The ribbing is a bit shorter, so stretch it a bit while pinning to work this into the sleeve.
 - Now, sew/serge the ribbing to the sleeve
 - Repeat for the other cuff

### Step 6: Attach the hem

 - Do for the hem as your did for the cuffs
 - Measure the width of Sven at the hem
 - Cut a piece of ribbing that 1.9 times this length and 7cm/3inch wide
 - You may need to attach different pieces if your ribbing fabric isn't wide enough
 - Fold the ribbing double along the longest side, and sew together the edge so you have a continous ring
 - Turn your Sven inside-out
 - Fold the ribbing ring with the good side outwards, and slip the folded side into your inside/out Sven body
 - Align the cut off side of the ribbing with the edge of the body and pin it in place. The ribbing is a bit shorter, so stretch it a bit while pinning to work this into the body.
 - Now, sew/serge the ribbing to the body
