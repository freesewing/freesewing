- - -

### Step 1: Close shoulder seams

- Place the back and front on top of each other with the good sides toghether.
- Align the shoulder seam, and sew/serge it at the standard seam allowance.
- Repeat for the other shoulder seam.

### Step 2: Set in the sleeves

- Place your now attached front and back with the good side up.
- Place a sleeve on top if it with the good side down
- Align the top of the sleevecap with the shoulder seam, your sleeve should lie over your front/back extending to the other shoulder seam
- Pin sleeve in place along the entire armhole. There's a bit of sleevecap ease, which means that the sleevehead is slightly longer than the armhole. Ease this in the top part of the sleeve head while pinning.
- Sew/serge your pinned sleeve in place
- Repeat for the other sleeve

### Step 3: Finish the neck binding

- Measure the length of the neck opening
- Cut a piece of ribbing that is this length and 6cm/2.5inch wide
- Fold the ribbing double with the good side outward, and pin it to your neckopening starting from the back
- The cut off side of your ribbing should align with the edge of your neck opening, while the ribbing extends over your sweatshirt
- Pin the ribbing in place around the neck opening, starting at the back and stretching it gently as you do so
- First, join the ribbing at center back, with good sides together. As you've been stretching the ribbing as you were pinning it, it will be too long. Simply cut that away
- Then, sew the ribbing to the neck opening

### Step 4: Close the side seams and sleeves

- Fold Sven double at the shoulder seams with good sides together
- Align the side seams and sleeves and pin them together
- Now, sew the side seam and continue sewing to close the arms all the way to the cuff
- Repeat on the other side

### Step 5: Attach the cuffs

- Measure the width of the sleeve at the cuff
- Cut a piece of ribbing that is (twice this length - 2cm/1inch) and 7cm/3inch wide
- Fold the ribbing double along the longest side, and sew together the edge so you have a continous ring
- Turn your Sven inside-out
- Fold the ribbing ring with the good side outwards, and slip the folded side into your inside/out Sven sleeve
- Align the cut off side of the ribbing with the edge of the sleeve and pin it in place. The ribbing is a bit shorter, so stretch it a bit while pinning to work this into the sleeve.
- Now, sew/serge the ribbing to the sleeve
- Repeat for the other cuff

### Step 6: Attach the hem

- Do for the hem as your did for the cuffs
- Measure the width of Sven at the hem
- Cut a piece of ribbing that 1.9 times this length and 7cm/3inch wide
- You may need to attach different pieces if your ribbing fabric isn't wide enough
- Fold the ribbing double along the longest side, and sew together the edge so you have a continous ring
- Turn your Sven inside-out
- Fold the ribbing ring with the good side outwards, and slip the folded side into your inside/out Sven body
- Align the cut off side of the ribbing with the edge of the body and pin it in place. The ribbing is a bit shorter, so stretch it a bit while pinning to work this into the body.
- Now, sew/serge the ribbing to the body
