 - **Main fabric**
   - Cut **1 Tamiko top** on the fold

Tamiko is a zero-waste pattern. It's a rectangle that's cut out on the fold. Not more than that. There's only one part to this top, we will simply refer to it at the **Tamiko top**. It needs to be cut on the fold along the bottom.

<Note>

Cut out the armhole, but leave seam allowance
