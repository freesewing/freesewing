-   Cut 1 back on the fold.
-   Cut 1 front on the fold.
-   Cut 2 sleeves *with good sides together*
    -   If you cut sleeves separately, remember that one has to be a mirror image of the other.

## Caveats

-   There is no seam allowance on the neck opening.
-   There is extra hem allowance at the hem and armholes.
