To make Teagan, you will need the following:
- [Grundlegendes Nähzubehör](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/patterns/teagan/fabric))

<!--- This link isn't a thing yet, but it follows the site nomenclature, so it should work when everything's up? --->

<Note>

##### A serger/overlock is nice, but optional
<p>As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life easier.</p>
<p>If you do not have one of those, don’t despair. You don’t really need it. All serged seams on the Teagan T-shirt can also be sewn with a narrow zigzag stitch (~2 mm wide) on a standard sewing machine.</p>
