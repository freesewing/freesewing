title: "Curve to waist"
---

Choose this option to draft Teagan to curve towards your waist before curving towards the hips.

If waist measurement (plus ease) is smaller than hips (plus ease), this creates an hourglass shape such as found in 'fitted' or 'ladies' T-shirts (as opposed to 'regular' or 'unisex').

<Note>
This option can also be used when the waist measurement exceeds the hip measurement, but this results in a non-standard T-shirt shape which may be impossible to put on.
