- The **front lining** is cut from the **front** part on your draft, down to the line just below the knee
- Pay attention to the grainline on the **fly piece**, **fly shield**, and **side piece**
- There are two variations of the front pocket bag. You need to cut out two of each:
  - Cut two of the complete piece
  - Cut two with only extending up to the dashed line at the left
- The **back inner pocket bag** and **back outer pocket bag** are very similar. Make sure to mark them correctly so you don't confuse them.

</Warning>
