<Tip>

##### Use the power of the *paperless* option - do *not* print this pattern  
  
Tiberius is just a big rectangle, so printing the pattern out is a bit of a waste. Save a tree, toggle the [paperless](/docs/guide/options/paperless) option, and copy the dimensions to your fabric, while respecting the grainline.

</Tip>

Tiberius consists of only one part, the *tunica*, that will act as a pattern for both front and back pieces.

- cut *2 tunicae*, _on the fold_

<Note>

##### Notes  
  
You have two options here: Either you cut your tunica in two pieces as described above, or you cut it in only one piece. Historically speaking, the time period or location you're aiming for can make a difference (ancient Rome vs. ancient Greece, for example). If you care about authenticity, I suggest researching this a bit.
