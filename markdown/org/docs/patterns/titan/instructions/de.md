###### Titan ist ein Grundschnitt, kein Schnittmuster

Ein Grundschnitt ist eine Grundform, auf der andere Schnittmuster basieren.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns so the instructions below will not go in depth about closures or finishes and are for the default Titan block.

### Step 1: Mock-up Construction

- Join the outseam (the seam that runs along the side of your leg) of the front and back.
- Join the inseam (the seam the runs along the inside of your legs) of the front and back.
- Du hast jetzt ein Bein. Wiederhole die Schritte für das andere Bein, **und stelle dabei sicher, dass die beiden Beine Spiegelbilder voneinander sind**.
- Turn one leg with the good side in, and the other with the good side out.
- Now tuck the _good side out_ into the _good side in_ leg, so that they have their _good sides together_.
- Align and sew the cross seam.

<Note>

You may need to leave an opening in the front cross seam so you can pin yourself in.

</Note>

<Tip>

If you are making adjustments you may wish to sew the seams _wrong sides together_ to make them easier to adjust.

</Tip>

### Schritt 2: Anprobieren

- Try it on and check the fit by pinning the front closed whilst wearing it.
- Make any alterations and try it on again.
- Repeat until you are happy.

<Tip>

Keep an eye out for anything you keep doing whilst wearing the mock-up, are you pulling it down? Constantly adjusting the shoulder? etc. Solche Dinge sind Zeichen dafür, wo das Schnittmuster möglicherweise angepasst werden muss.

Sometimes you may need to wear the mock-up for an extended amount of time to get a better sense of the fit so don't be afraid to walk around in it for a couple of hours.

</Tip>

<Note>

Remember to treat Titan as a basis rather than a final product, so adjust what you need to get the desired look.
For instance:

- Add a front closure
- Add pockets
- Change the pant length
- Change the pant width
- Add a waistband

It is all up to you! Experiment and go forth!

</Note>

### Schritt 3: Erstelle ein Papierschnittmuster

- Once happy with all your changes unpick your mockup and make a paper pattern based off of it.
- Jetzt hast du ein Schnittmuster, das du verwenden kannst um Kleidungsstücke herzustellen.

<Note>

It is best practice to make a paper pattern from the mock-up if you have made any alterations, as this will allow you to clean up any lines but also means you have a pattern that you can keep producing garments from.
