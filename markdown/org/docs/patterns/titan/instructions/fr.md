<Note>

###### Titan is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns so the instructions below will not go in depth about closures or finishes and are for the default Titan block.

### Etape 1 : Construction de la maquette

- Join the outseam (the seam that runs along the side of your leg) of the front and back.
- Join the inseam (the seam the runs along the inside of your legs) of the front and back.
- You now have a leg. Repeat for the other leg, **making certain they are mirror images of each other**.
- Turn one leg with the good side in, and the other with the good side out.
- Now tuck the _good side out_ into the _good side in_ leg, so that they have their _good sides together_.
- Align and sew the cross seam.

<Note>

You may need to leave an opening in the front cross seam so you can pin yourself in.

</Note>

<Tip>

If you are making adjustments you may wish to sew the seams wrong sides together to make them easier to adjust.

### Étape 2 : Essayez-le

- Essayez-le et vérifiez la coupe en épinglant le devant tout en le portant.
- Apportez les modifications nécessaires et essayez à nouveau le vêtement.
- Répétez l'opération jusqu'à ce que vous soyez satisfait.

<Tip>

Keep an eye out for anything you keep doing whilst wearing the mock-up, are you pulling it down? Ajuster constamment l'épaule ? ect... Ces éléments sont des signes indiquant que le modèle doit être ajusté.

Il est parfois nécessaire de porter la maquette pendant un certain temps pour avoir une meilleure idée de la coupe, alors n'hésitez pas à vous promener avec pendant quelques heures.

</Tip>

<Note>

Remember to treat Titan as a basis rather than a final product, so adjust what you need to get the desired look.\
For instance:

- Add a front closure
- Add pockets
- Change the pant length
- Change the pant width
- Add a waistband

It is all up to you!

### Étape 3 : Créer un modèle en papier

- Once happy with all your changes unpick your mockup and make a paper pattern based off of it.
- Now you have a pattern you can use to produce a garment.

<Note>

It is best practice to make a paper pattern from the mock-up if you have made any alterations, as this will allow you to clean up any lines but also means you have a pattern that you can keep producing garments from.
