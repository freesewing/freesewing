Controls the proportion between the front and back part of the legs.

The back of the trouser legs are always wider than the front. This controls by how much.

<Note>

Increasing this will make the front leg panel narrower.  
This makes the wearer look more skinny.

This trick is often used in womenswear jeans 
(now you know why you can't find womenswear jeans with functional front pockets).
