###### Choosing your tie grain

![One fabric, different grains, different ties. Don't worry about rules, make what you like](tie-grain.png)

This pattern does not include a grain line. The grain line is typically printed on the pattern to show you how to place your pattern on your fabric, relative to the fabric's grain.

For a tie, how you do this is not so much a rule as it is a personal choice. As such, there is no grain line printed on the pattern. You can do what you want.

That being said, a lot of ties are cut on bias, as this results in the best drape. If you are unsure what to do, consider cutting your tie on bias.

Si tout cela semble très confus, puis-je suggérer de lire la page d'aide sur [le droit fil de tissu](/docs/sewing/fabric-grain).
