<Note>

##### Notes
  
- Ursula is a great scrap buster. If you have fabric scraps from making a [Teagan t-shirt](/designs/teagan/) or anything from a jersey fabric that has good stretch, this is a good way to use those up.
- You can use the same fabric for the whole garment, including the gusset lining. Some people prefer to use a cotton jersey instead to line the gusset. If you want to do that, cut **1 gusset** from your main fabric and **1 gusset** from your lining fabric.
