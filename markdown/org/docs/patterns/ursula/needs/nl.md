To make Ursula, you will need the following:
- [Basis naaimateriaal](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.7 meter of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric options](/docs/patterns/ursula/fabric))
- About 3 meters of underwear elastic, such as picot elastic or fold over elastic

<Tip>

##### Binding methods may affect the seam allowance

If using fold over elastic (FOE) or doing knit binding, you may wish to trim away the seam allowance at the legs and waist before cutting. If you keep the seam allowance, the finished product will have a slightly higher waist and slightly smaller leg openings.

  ##### A serger/overlock is nice, but optional
As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life easier. Als je geen overlock hebt, geen zorg. Je hebt het niet echt nodig. You can just sew Ursula with a zigzag stitch.
