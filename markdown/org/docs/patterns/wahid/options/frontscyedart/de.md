This pattern comes with a default 1 cm scye dart (think armhole dart) at the front.

You can increase or decrease the dart to influence the armhole.

> #### What's the point?
> 
> The point of this dart is to make sure the armhole lies flat against your body, rather than gape. Given that there is no sleeve, a gaping armhole is particularly unsightly.

> While this dart is used to shape the pattern, you don't have to sew the dart because it's incorporated in the front dart.
