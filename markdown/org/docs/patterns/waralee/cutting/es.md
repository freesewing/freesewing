Waralee consists of two identical pieces of fabric. They are basically big rectangles with pieces missing. As such, it is easier to print out the piece you need to cut out and measure the rest, than it is to print out everything and cut the pattern the traditional way.

The pattern is available both ways. You can print out the whole thing, tape all the pages together, and use that to cut out the fabric. It is also possible to print out only the part that you need to cut out. This part has a negative seam allowance, since you'll be using it opposite of what you normally use the pattern pieces for.

Pattern piece 2 is just for when you want to make the pants without printing everything.
Since this is just a couple of rectangles (with a slanted side), you can just use a ruler to cut out the main part. Then you use Part 2 to cut out the crotch part. Save a tree.

If you opt for the cut-out method, use the paperless view to see all the dimensions of the pattern.
You will need to cut a narrow strip out from what will become the front, and a small triangle and strip from what will become the back.
And in the middle between these will be the little cut-out pattern piece.
Make sure you measure this correctly, and you have the fabric squared before you start cutting.
