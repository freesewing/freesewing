### Main Fabric

Los pantalones de envoltura son un poco informales y perfectos para el clima cálido. You can't go wrong with **linen** and **cotton** is a good option too. This is a type of wrap pants, which leaves the sides of your legs exposed at times. And as such, it is mostly worn in warmer weather, or inside. To get a good effect of the flowing of the legs, don't use very heavy materials. Good types of fabric are **linen**, and **linen blends**. These mostly have a nice drape and are cool. Heavy materials like denim are less useful so should be avoided.
