##### The key to Waralee is the waist band

In a way, Waralee is just a waist band with a long piece of fabric attached. The waist band needs to continue from the fabric into two strings of fabric that are used to tie the pants in the front and two in the back. These strings are not included in the pattern. Traditionally, they are of similar length. You can make longer ones for the front panel (the side that is a little shorter than the other, on the left in the illustrations below), to allow you to tie both sets in the front. I prefer this as it is easier to tie, and you don't have the bulk of the knot in the back.

</Warning>

### Step 1: Sew the pockets

<Note>

##### Les poches sont optionnelles

Traditionnellement, ce type de pantalon n'a pas de poches. Mais je veux mettre mon téléphone, mes clés et mon portefeuille quelque part. J'ai donc inclus des poches dans le motif. Vous pouvez décider par vous-même si vous le souhaitez sur votre pantalon.

Les illustrations des étapes suivantes montrent les pantalons Waralee sans poches. Seuls les emplacements de poche du modèle sont affichés, pour vous aider à vous orienter.

##### Si vous voulez des poches, faites-les d'abord

si vous voulez faire les poches, les faire avant de mettre un morceau de tissu sur l'autre. Il est plus facile de travailler avec les pièces encore séparées.

</Note>

-   If desired, sew the pockets.

<Note>

I included placements for the front pockets that will be hidden by the flaps in the front. But they will still be easily accessible to put your phone or keys in. These are single welt pockets. The ones in the front are at an angle and the ones in the back are horizontally oriented. The pocket templates should allow for enough fabric to attach the pocket to the waistband. If you want particularly deep pockets, please adjust accordingly.

</Note>

### Step 2: Hem the sides and bottom

![Hem the sides and bottom](waralee-hem-sides-and-bottom.png)

-   Hem the sides
-   Hem the bottom.

<Note>

You can use whatever method works best for you. In the version I first made I just serged the sides, folded them back and top stitched them, then did the same for the bottom. I did this to keep the bulk of the fabric to a minimum and allow for a better drape. What you do should depend on the type of fabric you're using.

</Note>

### Step 3: Sew the two pants parts together at the crotch

![Lay the two parts on top of one another with good sides together. Sew the crotch seam](waralee-crotch-seam-no-pockets.png)

Now you get to sew the two pants parts together.

-   Lay the two pants parts on top of one another with *good sides together* and sew the seam along the cutout.
-   *Finish* this seam and press it.

### Step 4: Prepare the four strings

The strings are just long tubes of fabric.

-   Take a quarter of your waist measurement. Add that number to 40cm (17”). Add your seam allowance. This is the length of each string.
-   Cut out four strips of fabric that are that long and 5cm (2”) wide.

<Tip>

For example, if my waist circumference is 84.6cm: 84.6cm divided by 4 is 21.2cm. 21.2cm plus 40cm is 61.2cm. 61.2cm plus my seam allowance of 1cm is 62.2cm. I will cut four strips of fabric that are 62.2cm by 5cm.

</Tip>

<Note>

##### You can lengthen the front ties

Optionally, to make the front ties longer, extend them by your quarter waist measurement.

When generating your pattern, one of the style options is called “Waist Band”. The strings, when folded, should have the same width as you specified for that option, 2.5cm (1") by default.

The extra 40cm (17") of length is to make the knot.

If your material is delicate or flimsy, you can add some interfacing to this to give it strength.

</Note>

-   Fold them in half along the long side, *good sides together*.
-   Stitch the long side and one of the short sides,
-   Turn the tie right side out.

<Tip>

##### Tourner les tubes du côté droit du tissu peut être difficile

Cela peut être facilité en prenant un morceau de twine plus long que les bandes. Dites que entre les côtés de droite, le long du pli. Assurez-vous de bien l'attraper en couturant le côté court. Vous pouvez l'utiliser pour tirer la fin à travers le tube que vous avez créé. Lorsque vous avez terminé, vous pouvez le couper. Avoir un long bâton skinny ou un tourneur de boucle peut également aider à cela.

</Tip>

### Step 5: Sew the waist band

![Lay the two parts on top of one another with good sides together. Sew the crotch seam](waralee-waist-band-no-pockets.png)

Now it is time to sew the waist band.

-   If your fabric is delicate, add interfacing to the wrong side of the pants above the waist band line. (red)
-   Fold the seam allowance in, and then fold along the waist band line. (red)
-   Insert one of the strings you made in the previous step on each side.
-   Sew along the waist band line, and add some additional stitching to make sure those strings are attached well. (blue)

<Warning>

##### Secure the strings well

The strings keep your pants up, so having that stitching fail will result in awkward moments.

</Warning>

### Step 6: Wear your pants

Press your pants, and try them on!

Hold the front side against your belly and wrap both strings around you and tie in the back (or, if you have long strings, wrap them all the way around you and tie in the front). Then hand the back side through your legs to yourself and tie the other strings in the front.
