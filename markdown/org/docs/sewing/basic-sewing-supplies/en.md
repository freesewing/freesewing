> What exactly constitutes the bare necessities for sewing is subject to debate. 
> Some people like more tools, others say that even a sewing machine is optional as you can sew by hand.

For the sake of clarity, when I refer to basic sewing supplies on this website, I mean the following:

 - Tape measure
 - Sewing machine
   - Sewing machine needles
   - Bobbins
 - Sewing thread
 - Fabric scissors
 - Seam ripper
 - Pins and hand sewing needles
 - Fabric marker/Pencils
 - An iron
