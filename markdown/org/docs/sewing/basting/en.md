Basting is temporary sewing to hold things in place.

It is typically done by hand, but you can also machine baste.

Examples of where basting is commonly used are:

- Basting a seam in place before sewing it
- Basting an ornament, pocket, or other part in place before attaching it
- Basting darts or other pattern changes while fitting the garment on a model

Basting is never permanent, but merely a temporary measure to hold things in place.

> Basting and pinning are different techniques for similar situations
