jargon: true
---

The _high point shoulder_ or _HPS_ point is used as the base for several vertical measurements.

The HPS is where your shoulder seam would meet your neck.
The point is situated where your neck meets your shoulder.
If you put a marble there, it should not roll forward or backward, but roll towards your shoulder (as in, it should sit in the middle)
