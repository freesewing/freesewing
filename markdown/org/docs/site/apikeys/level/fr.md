The permission level is a number from `0` to `4` with the following significance:

- `0` : Authenticate only
- `1` : Read access to your own patterns and measurements sets
- `2` : Read access to all your account data
- `3` : Write access to your own patterns and measurements sets
- `4` : Write access to all your account data
