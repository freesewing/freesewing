title: Pattern expansion
---

This option suppresses all efforts to make the pattern consume less
space/paper.

Designers will often take steps to reduce the amount of paper consumed by a
pattern.  For example, a strip of fabric used for binding, or a simple
rectangular part may not be included, or only partially.

This option -- which is disabled by default -- allows you to suppress the space
saving and indicate you rather want to get full-sized views on all pattern
parts.
