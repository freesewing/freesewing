title: Paperless Patterns
---

The paperless setting lets you generate a sewing pattern that includes extra
dimensions as well as a grid (in either metric or imperial, based on your
choice of units). 

This allows you to skip printing the pattern altogether. Instead you can
transfer it directly onto the fabric, or an intermediate medium such as pattern
paper.
