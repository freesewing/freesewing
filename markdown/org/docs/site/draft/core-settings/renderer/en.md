title: Render Engine
---

This setting allows you to choose how your pattern will be rendered. In other
words, how it will be drawn on the screen.  There are two options:

- `React` allows for more interactivity, and is optimized for displaying
  patterns on-screen
- `SVG` does not allow interactivity like the `React` option does. Instead it
  is optimized for printing

By default, this website only uses SVG when you are exporting your pattern.
While you are generating and tweaking your pattern, we use React, unless you
use this setting to change that to SVG.
