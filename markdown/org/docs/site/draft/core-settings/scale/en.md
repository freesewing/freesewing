title: Scale
---

The scale settings allow you to scale those parts of a pattern that do not scale with measurements.
Things like logos, line widths, font sizes, and so on.

This setting was added at the requests of people who like to use our patterns to make doll clothes.
When generating such a small pattern, the arrowheads, titles, and so on tend to obscure much of the pattern.
This setting allows you to scale them down or -- if you so wich -- scale them up.
