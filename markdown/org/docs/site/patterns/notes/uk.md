title: "Patterns: Notes"
---

Every pattern has a **notes** attribute that is optional.

The notes field allows you to add your notes to a pattern. This field supports markdown, so you can use rich formatting, or even embed images.

<Note>
If you make your pattern public, your notes will also be public.
