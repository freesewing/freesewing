title: "Measurements Sets: Public"
---

Every measurements set has a **public** attribute that controls whether or not the measurments set is public.

By default, measurements sets are private and you are the only one who can use them.

But, you can choose to make your measurments set public which allows other
users to utilize the measurements in this set to generate or test their own
patterns.

<Note>
If you make your measurements set public, this applies to all data in the measurements set.
In other words, not only the measurements, but also the name, notes, and picture will be visible to other users.
