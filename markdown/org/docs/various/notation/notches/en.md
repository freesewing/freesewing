title: Notches
---

There are two types of notches. The default notch is a dot in a circle.

An alternative style shows a cross in a circle.
This style is used to indicate the back of a garment.
For example, on a sleevecap you may see a dot and a cross notch.
This way you know which side of the sleevecap is the back (the one with the cross notch).

##### Why we chose these notches

In electromagnetism, a ⊙ symbol is used to indicate a flow of current coming towards you (to the front),
whereas ⊗ is used for a current moving away from you (to the back).

You can also think of an arrow. When an arrow flies towards you, you see its tip (⊙).
When an arrow flies away from you, you see its fletches (⊗).
