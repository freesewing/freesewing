title: Titles
---

Each pattern piece has a title that tells you the number and name of the piece, as well as the pattern name:  
<Legend part="title" caption="Example of a title" />

<Note>
When you generate a pattern on freesewing.org, the title will also include the name of the person the pattern was made for.
