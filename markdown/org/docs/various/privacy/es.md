**Last update**: 8 January 2021

This privacy notice describes the personal data we store. It outlines why we need the data, how long we keep it, and whether we share it with any third-parties.

We are confident it will demonstrate our commitment to privacy.

For clarity, we've broken this up in four different types of roles:

 - For **visitors of our website**, we store **[visitor data](/docs/various/privacy/visitor/)**
 - For **subscribers to our newsletter**, we store **[subscriber data](/docs/various/privacy/subscriber/)**
 - For **users with an account** on our website, we store **[account data](/docs/various/privacy/account/)**
 - For **users with an account that contains people**, we store **[people data](/docs/various/privacy/people/)**

Here are the relevant sections:

<Tip>

##### These roles are typically cumulative

If you are a newsletter subscriber, you are also a visitor.
And if you are a user with one or more models, you are also a user, and also a visitor.
