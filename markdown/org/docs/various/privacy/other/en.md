##### Full disclosure

If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform both you and the authorities.

If you believe your personal data has been compromised, please contact joost@joost.at.


##### Service Providers

Our hosting provider manages our backend systems for us. This includes hosting, storage, and backup. 

While this means they process your data (in the strict sense of the word), they do not require access to information about you. 
Furthermore, as we encrypt profile data at rest, it is non-trivial for them to access it even if they wanted to.

##### Law enforcement

While we have no intention of sharing any of your personal data, we are not above the law.

If we are required to do so by law, or if we feel that doing so would be the lesser evil, we will disclose personal data.

So far, we have not received any request from law enforcement to disclose information about one of our users.
We have also not disclosed any personal information for any other reason.

##### Use by minors under the age of 16

For legal reasons, you need to be at least 16 years old to use freesewing.
