##### What personal data do we store?

- Body measurements
- Whether the model has breasts or not
- Optional: An avatar for the model

##### Why do we need it?

- We need the body measurements to draft made-to-measure sewing patterns
- We use the information about whether a model has breasts to only show relevant measurements when configuring the model
- The model avatar only serves to help you differentiate between your different models

##### How long do we keep it?

- We keep model data up to 12 months after your last login, or until you remove it.

##### Do we share it?

- We never share personal model data
- We publish an open data set of measurements, containing fully anonymized data.
