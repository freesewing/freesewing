title: How we use your personal data
---

For clarity, we've broken this up in three different types of roles:

 - For visitors, we store [visitor data](#visitor-data)
 - For users, we store [profile data](#profile-data)
 - For users with one or more models, we store [model data](#model-data)

These roles are cumulative. If you are a user, you are also a visitor. And if you are a user with one or more models, you are also a user, and also a visitor.

   - The model avatar only serves to help you differentiate between your different models

   - We keep model data up to 12 months after your last login, or until you remove it.
