title: How we use your personal data
---

For clarity, we've broken this up in three different types of roles:

-   For visitors, we store [visitor data](#visitor-data)
-   For users, we store [profile data](#profile-data)
-   For users with one or more models, we store [model data](#model-data)

These roles are cumulative. If you are a user, you are also a visitor. And if you are a user with one or more models, you are also a user, and also a visitor.

    -   Body measurements
    -   Whether the model has breasts or not

    -   The model avatar only serves to help you differentiate between your different models
