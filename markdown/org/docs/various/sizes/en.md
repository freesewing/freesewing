title: Sizing tables
---

FreeSewing does not use sizes. All our patterns are drafted to a set of measurements.

Since version 2.2 however, we do provide *standard sizes*.
Each size is a set of measurements that is an estimation of what a person with a given
neck circumference could have as measurements.

This is not an exact science. We provide these sizes as a fast and easy way to
get started with our patterns. But we do hope that you will take the time to take
your own measurements, or have them taken. This will always yield better results.

<Tip>

##### Open in a wide view

These tables take up a lot or screen real-estate, which is why we
[show sizes in a wide view](/sizes/).
