title: Tablas de tamaño
---

FreeSewing no utiliza tamaños. Todos nuestros patrones están redactados a un conjunto de mediciones.

Since version 2.2 however, we do provide _standard sizes_. Each size is a set of measurements that is an estimation of what a person with a given neck circumference could have as measurements.

Esto no es una ciencia exacta. We provide these sizes as a fast and easy way to get started with our patterns. But we do hope that you will take the time to take your own measurements, or have them taken. Esto siempre dará mejores resultados.

<Tip>

##### Open in a wide view

These tables take up a lot or screen real-estate, which is why we
[show sizes in a wide view](/sizes/).
