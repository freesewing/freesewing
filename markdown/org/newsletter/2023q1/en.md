Welcome to the 2023 Winter edition of the FreeSewing newsletter.

First up: Happy new year to those who celebrate. May 2023 bring you everything you've hoped for, and perhaps some nice surprises too.

As is a tradition this time of the year, our contributors enjoy a break to enjoy the holidays, and what you'll find below is made up almost entirely of the ramblings of me, Joost.

In addition, it's new year's day, so I'm not going to make this too long. Here's what's in store today:
 
- üèÅ 2022 was the year of FreeSewing 2.22 (1-minute read - by Joost)
- ‚úã 2023 will be the year of FreeSewing 3 (1-minute read - by Joost)
- üíú The cost of loving (2-minute read - by Joost)
- üïµÔ∏è Behind the Seams: Zwaluw (4-minute read - by Karen & Zwaluw)

Let's get right to it.

## üèÅ 2022 was the year of FreeSewing 2.22

You won't find this on the list of any 2022 retrospective, but this is not a newsletter for hot takes about the news, this is the FreeSewing newsletter. And for us, 2022 was the year we release FreeSewing v2.22 and decided it would be the last v2 release ever.

The [FreeSewing contributor call of 20 august 2022](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/discussions/2582) marks the official moment were we decided to wrap up development of v2 with one final release, and then turn our attention to version 3.

In the months leading up to this moment, we had already made great strides in trying to implement many of the things on [our road map](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/discussions/1278), and it feels weird to me somehow that only four months have passed since when I think about all the work that has been done on v3.

On the developer side of things, we've completely switched over already. FreeSewing.dev holds our developer documentation for v3, while the _legacy_ v2 documentation is relegated to v2.freesewing.dev.

Our development environment for v3 is also ready ‚Äî run `npx @freesewing/new-design@next` to try it yourself ‚Äî and we also rewrote our backend to support our future plans, like hooking up our development environment to the backend so designers can use the measurements data they have stored in their FreeSewing account to test their designs.

## ‚úã 2023 will be the year of FreeSewing 3 

The current `next` release of FreeSewing is v3.0.0-alpha.4. The race has started now to turn that into `beta` and then finally put it in production on FreeSewing.org. 

I've talked about some of the new things in FreeSewing v3 in [our last newsletter](https://freesewing.org/newsletter/2022q4/).
I could talk about it more, but talk is cheap. You want to see it, right? Well you can't. It's not ready.
It was also not supposed to be ready. We started the effort late in August this year, and from the very start put the release at _sometime in 2023_. 

But, you can start the clock today and I promise that it will be out before the end of the year. If it's Q4, I will be a bit disappointed. If it's Q3, I will be happy. If it's Q2 I will be thrilled. And if it's Q1 I'll be very surprised.

The only thing that's really left to do right now ‚Äî apart from copious amounts of polish and bug fixes obviously ‚Äî is to write a new frontend. In other words, a new FreeSewing.org where you can actually use all of the cool stuff we've been working on.

In many ways, it will be the crowning achievement of version 3. The thing that brings everything together. 

No pressure.

## üíú The cost of loving

FreeSewing's revenue during 2022 was `9.325,54` euro. That's down from `10.070,77` in 2021, which was in turn lower than the `10.736,82` of revenue in 2020. Still, it's more than double of the `4.109,38` euro revenue of 2019 and I think that's worth pointing out because 2019 was the last pre-pandemic year. 

We've seen an enormous influx of users, patrons, and revenue in 2020 undoubtedly because [our face mask pattern](https://freesewing.org/designs/florence/) was wildly popular during the PPE shortage that year. That peak has been tapering off ever since, and has pushed year-on-year revenue into a downward trend. Furthermore, inflation and the cost of living crisis has been particularly tangible this year, and I've received more than one apologetic message from patrons who wanted to continue supporting us but felt obliged to cut us from their monthly budget to ensure they would be able to support themselves and/or their families.

So I don't feel bad about revenue being lower this year. I think it's been a difficult year for many people, and we have always been looking for support from those who could spare it without hardship. Yes, it's nice to break the `10.000` barrier. Yes, I would love to get to `12.000` and reach `1.000` MRR (monthly recurring revenue) but I'm not going to let that get in the way of being proud of the work we do.

I am proud not only of the work we do, but because FreeSewing is a force for good in this world.
With the addition of this year's `9.325,54`, FreeSewing's contributions to [M√©decins sans fronti√®res/Doctors Without Borders](https://www.msf.org/) stands at `38.814,94` euro or about 41.6k US dollar. Money that helps people who are in a worse situation than we all are.

So I am proud of those numbers, and most of all I am proud of the FreeSewing patrons who are behind them. They are the real heroes.

## üïµÔ∏è Behind the Seams: Zwaluw

One of our Contributor Call hosts sat down (virtually) with Zwaluw (who goes by Z or Zee) to learn a little more about their background and journey to becoming a FreeSewing contributor! The interview below has been edited for length, and any errors, oversights, etc. are entirely the fault of the interviewer!

### How did you learn about FreeSewing?
I don‚Äôt remember! I‚Äôm very active now, but I remember looking at the site a long while back and thinking it was cool, but I don‚Äôt remember how I got there‚Ä¶ Maybe googling made-to-measure patterns?

### How did you become a contributor?
That I do remember, it was writing documentation! I don‚Äôt remember if Starf asked or I offered, but my first project was writing the documentation for [Lunetius](https://freesewing.org/designs/lunetius/), a historical Roman cloak.

### What has been your contributor work so far?
My first contribution work was the documentation for Lunetius, and I still help with documentation sometimes, but I‚Äôve also started developing patterns. In particular, I‚Äôve made [Lucy](https://freesewing.org/designs/lucy/), a historical tie-on pocket, and Jane. Jane is a to-be-released shift pattern (or underwear for historical garments), and there‚Äôs not a lot of patterns out there for those. For so many people in the historical sewing community, you make a shift and get it over with, and that‚Äôs not me. Jane gives you options on a pattern that‚Äôs pretty loosely fitted, but you might want more or less ease, different sleeves, etc.

### Are you a sewist? A coder? Both? Neither?
I‚Äôm definitely both! I‚Äôve sewn for much longer, and FreeSewing is how I started to learn Javascript and Markdown. I‚Äôd wanted to learn, but I had done absolutely no coding before, and something about FreeSewing really appealed. I think because I thought, ‚ÄúIf I learn this, I can make a pattern.‚Äù It‚Äôs a really cool way to learn about web design and how to build websites, and I love joining the Contributor Calls. (Note from the interviewer: you too can join the Contributor Calls, every other Saturday! Schedules and agendas are posted in the [Discussions](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/discussions) section of the FreeSewing monorepo on Github. The next one is [January 7th!](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/discussions/3201))

### When and why did you start sewing?
I first started sewing around when I was ten years old, so sixteen years ago, and I‚Äôve been making my own clothes for most of that time. At some point, I got into historical sewing, and it definitely influences my modern clothing. I like to make historical things that also work for me in my daily life. For example, I wear a lot of walking skirts.

My dream project is a Victorian bustle gown, but it‚Äôs a lot of work. I do have a lobster bustle and corset, so maybe I will do a corset cover next‚Ä¶

### What are you currently working on?
Right now, I‚Äôm working on a quilt in shades of blue that is all hand sewn.

I like to have multiple types of projects going at once, though, so I am also working on a warm winter skirt made from IKEA flannel bedsheets in a beautiful gray and white plaid. Currently, I‚Äôm debating how to create the flannel waistband while keeping it from getting too bulky. I‚Äôve also got some 1780s stays that are hand sewn except for the boning channels, with synthetic whalebone boning, and I need to make a bunch of new shifts, as some of my current ones are getting worn out.

### Which project did you just finish?
The skirt I‚Äôm wearing! It‚Äôs a wool skirt for going to Troms√∏, Norway in the Arctic Circle and I needed very warm stuff for that. While I was there, I also made so many napkins for the people whose house I was staying in. Sometimes I‚Äôll use handcrafts as a fidget.

### What sewing/coding project are you most proud of?
I think I‚Äôm most proud of Jane, a shift designed on FreeSewing that‚Äôs slated for release in 2023. That was my first coding project, and it‚Äôs done now, and functional! [Lucy](https://freesewing.org/designs/lucy/) I slapped together in a weekend, while Jane I‚Äôve been working on for a year. 

### What in your life are you most proud of?
My family isn‚Äôt super crafty, but both my grandmothers were sewists, and my Dutch grandmother was a weaver, and I‚Äôm definitely proud that I‚Äôm continuing that, even though they never got a chance to teach me. I have my grandmother‚Äôs old looms, and my great grandmother's sewing machine. Looms are too big for a studio, but the sewing machine is one of those ancient black cast iron Singers that you crank by hand, and it still works! I can‚Äôt date it specifically, because it is from before they had serial numbers (which means it‚Äôs pre-1860s).

### What do you love the most about sewing?
I love the meditative aspect of sewing. I can‚Äôt do meditation, and I‚Äôm not a mindfulness person, but when I sit down with a project and hand stitch, it‚Äôs very calming. I will machine stitch some things, too, but I find myself thinking: ‚ÄúThis is so fast, I don‚Äôt enjoy this.‚Äù

### What‚Äôs the hardest part of sewing to you?
The historical sewing community can be pretty inaccessible ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt have a lot of money or time, then getting into this hobby can be really hard, and I wish that wasn‚Äôt the case. It‚Äôs part of what makes FreeSewing so cool ‚Äì everyone‚Äôs donating their time and skills, so you‚Äôre not paying $30 for a pattern that doesn‚Äôt even properly fit you.

For me personally, I think the hardest part is pacing, and making sure I don‚Äôt overdo it and hurt my hands. I do my best to have projects in different buckets: complicated, easy, practical‚Ä¶ And I switch between them to not completely burn myself out. I need to recognize when I need to not sew for a few days, and then usually I end up switching to FreeSewing things!

### What would be your advice for starting sewists?
Do something you enjoy. Even if it‚Äôs a big project and it‚Äôs overwhelming, it‚Äôs more fun to do that than to do something easy. And don‚Äôt forget your thimble. Historical costuming folks so often don‚Äôt have a thimble, or don‚Äôt stitch ergonomically, and it can really hurt your hands. I did not start out as a hand sewist ‚Äì I took a class with Sarah at Williamsburg.  I basically spent an hour sewing, and my hands hurt, and it didn‚Äôt work, and she saw and taught me her method. I‚Äôve been handsewing ever since. (You can find Sarah on Instagram at [@sewnstories](https://www.instagram.com/sewnstories/).)

### Do you sew mostly for yourself, or for others like friends and family?
I sew mostly for myself. I have made things for other people occasionally, but not a lot. Sometimes I have a time where I don‚Äôt have enough spoons and I really want to make things, but I already have enough towels, aprons, etc. So then I‚Äôll make things for other people. And I am theoretically available for commissions (but it‚Äôs slow).

### What are you up to when you‚Äôre not making clothes or designing patterns?
Reading books ‚Äì I don‚Äôt have any favorite genres, but my favorite author is Terry Pratchett. I‚Äôm excited that we‚Äôre finally getting a Discworld movie version that looks good! Besides reading, I spend some of my time playing video games (I‚Äôm currently playing Destiny 2) and resting.

### Would you like to share ways to follow you on social media?
I‚Äôm bad about posting, but my Instagram is [@zwaluwz](https://www.instagram.com/zwaluwz/). It also includes pictures of my cat, who was leash-trained!

### Do you have pets? Family?
I had a cat named Q, but he passed away last April. I‚Äôm hoping to move, so that I can have a cat again, because my landlord won‚Äôt let me get a new cat.

### Are you a dog person or a cat person?
Both! I do not discriminate in animals. I got to handle a bunch of snakes once, and it was the happiest I‚Äôve ever been. Maybe I should just get a lizard‚Ä¶ Or a hognose snake‚Ä¶

### If there was one thing you could take with you to an uninhabited island, what would it be? Why?
A sewing project! 

### If there was one person you could take with you to an uninhabited island, who would it be? Why?
I don‚Äôt think I would take people, I‚Äôd just have a nice quiet time.
