One day there was an unexpected delivery on my doorstep. I wasn't really certain what to make of it because I didn't recall ordering anything lately. Suffice to say I was not at all prepared for the awesomeness inside because when I opened the box I found this lovingly handcrafted real-life version of Skully, FreeSewing's beloved logo and mascot.

This is the wonderful work for Wouter who also made [the design](/designs/skully). So you can go and [make a Skully for yourself](/new/skully). You know you want one!
