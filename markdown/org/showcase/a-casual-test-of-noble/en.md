A FreeSewing maker shared this version of the Noble body block.

They said:

> This was quite interesting to sew up and I'm surprised how well it fits! The material is an old pillowcase. I added seam allowances everywhere except the neckline and arm holes. The princess seams on the front and back matched perfectly. The pattern pieces aligned pretty well everywhere.

> There are some obvious fit issues: 1) the front shoulder/armpit has some extra fabric and 2) the center back is tight. These can safely be attributed to the model, not the pattern -- I didn't make any adjustments for my body's pretty dramatic asymmetry (one shoulder is lower than the other) and I believe my chest measurement increased between when I last updated my FreeSewing measurements and when I generated this pattern.

> Still sharing in hopes the photos have some value to the designer and/or future makers!
