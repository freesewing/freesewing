Maker moderndragon used the FreeSewing options to customize the fit for their first Aaron. They went with slightly more ease than default, made slightly wider straps, put the straps slightly more towards the outside, and went with the "draft for high bust" option.

They said it's very comfy! We think it's a great result!
