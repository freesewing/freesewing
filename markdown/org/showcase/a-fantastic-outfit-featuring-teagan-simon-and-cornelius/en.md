This showcase is really something special -- it features, not one, not two, but THREE FreeSewing patterns!

The shirt is a modified Teagan, surcoat is Simon, and the breeches are Cornelius.

And if that wasn't already fantastic enough, they're all made from recycled materials.

We're huge fans of this look, the maker's first complete outfit!
