We love this very wearable Tristan top which is reversible and has boning in the front.

The maker shared that they are pretty happy with how it turned out, though ~~if~~ when they make another one they'll reduce the ease a bit, it fits fine over a sweater but it's a bit loose on its own/over a lighter top.
