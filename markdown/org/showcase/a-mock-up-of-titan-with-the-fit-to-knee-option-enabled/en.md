A FreeSewing maker shared this mock-up of Titan. She reported being overall very happy with the results for a first attempt. Her main adjustment will be to raise the waist of the back piece. The maker mentioned that she usually has fit issues with off-the-rack pants and is excited that Titan will be a great starting point for clothes that suit her.
