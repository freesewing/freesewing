The maker said:

"Made a bunch of changes to fit this in some teeny fabric remnants. Changes: shortened by around -30%, reduced to 1 dart, split the pieces into 3, sewed two mini vents of around 7cm on the front, added hem bonus of +5% in the lab, reduced waistband length so there’s no overlap. Unlined. Used a regular zipper. Might not still count as a Penelope… more of a Penny maybe! Happy with the result! Feel it will be very wearable."
