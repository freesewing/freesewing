This Aaron was maker braveness23's first project! He shared some helpful construction details:

"I serged the sides and tops of the arms.  I sewed the bottom hem with a double needle on my Brother sewing machine.  And I follow [this [Single Fold Knit Binding Youtube video]](https://youtu.be/DIxlWrmNayY) for the neck and arms.  For the later I used a double needle, surger thread and a super low bobbin tension on my Bernina sewing machine"

He mentioned that it was a really good fit but doesn't conceal his parastomal hernia, but it wasn't designed for that purpose. Also, he wishes he had made the armholes a lot smaller. We appreciate when folks share these kinds of details for the benefit of future makers!

Great work, braveness23!
