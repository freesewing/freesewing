The maker raised the arm holes on this Aaron A-shirt. She shared:

"I've been making Aarons!  I want to use them as undershirts so I've pulled the armholes up very high (-12% if I remember right, for sweat catching reasons)  and I need to bring the neckline down so that it'll still be below any buttons I like to leave undone. This one is great for today's gym trip though!"

Great result!
