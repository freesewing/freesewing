Are you as crazy about this Sven sweatshirt as we are and sad that you don't have this fabric? Never fear! The maker, Bumble, says you can find it on Etsy with the keyword "Otter slide French Terry".

The maker mentioned that this Sven turned out a lot shorter than they'd like, but I have enough other fabric left to lengthen it if necessary.
