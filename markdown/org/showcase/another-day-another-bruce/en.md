These Bruce boxer briefs are by William. Don't miss his first version, also in the FreeSewing showcase.

William reports that the fabric was a pain to work with and doesn't have quite as much stretch as a jersey, so it's a bit tight, but they fit. We're glad he stuck with it for this great-looking make.
