intro: "This Bee variation was made as a pattern test with cross-back ties, and has a few modifications from the default Bee. The top of the cup is lowered, and there is a small dart along the bottom of each cup taking up some of the gathering. There is also clear elastic sewn into the seams along the band, and a layer of power mesh in the cups, for additional support."

This Bee variation was made as a pattern test with cross-back ties, and has a few modifications from the default Bee. The top of the cup is lowered, and there is a small dart along the bottom of each cup taking up some of the gathering. There is also clear elastic sewn into the seams along the band, and a layer of power mesh in the cups, for additional support.

Because a swim top is even better with coordinating bottoms, I also made a high-rise Ursula to match!
