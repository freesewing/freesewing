Bibi was my second foray into garment construction and fitting things to my unique body shape. I used the same fabric as I did for my Titan project, a medium weight french terry with good 2-way stretch.

My experience was more challenging with Bibi as with Titan. I think this was partly because I don't understand all the options for Bibi and didn't make such careful and informed choices when I generated the pattern. (I didn't have a favorite shirt I was using as a template or comparing pattern shapes to, because none of my shirts really fit how I like!)

Also, sleeves are hard.

During the process, I immediately really liked how the Bibi main body fit on me. It followed my shape with a comfortable ease. And of course I made it the exact body length I prefer (I am tall, and often buy men's tops as a middle aged cis woman, just to get things that are long enough and not full of bust ease I don't need). I altered the waist-to-hip shape since I had bumps of extra fabric on the bottom of the side seams with the default Bibi. This was easily fixed by making a more angular A-line shape instead. I have since discovered that the Bibi pattern can do this for me using the Waist Adjustment and Curvature Adjustment in the Advanced design options - very cool.

Two things I noted and wanted to change about the basted mock-up, but didn't see how to fix:

1. The sleeves had nearly 0% ease around the elbow. Perhaps it is because the pattern was based on my unusually tiny wrist measurement? I set the pattern for 100% length long sleeves, the default 5% Biceps Ease (maybe too low for my tastes?) and 20% Sleeve Fullness, and sewed along the pattern lines accurately. Luckily my fabric is plenty stretchy and was aligned properly for circumference stretch when I cut the sleeves, so the shirt is still totally wearable.

2. I was dissatisfied with the shoulder point and armscye fit. Some fabric bunching/pooling in the front of the armscye and upper bust, and some tightness across the back shoulders. Not a huge problem with the stretch fabric, but not really cut to suit my forward shoulders. The tight arms are likely causing the issue as well. There's nowhere for the ease and tightness to redistribute itself or drape out like it would in a normal T-shirt.

When I tried pinning things or staring at the pattern to see what I could change to make the shoulder/armscye how I want, as a beginner I just couldn't make it work. Likely a completely different sleeve design would suit my needs better right now. (I was thinking a raglan sleeve would be better for playing around with.) So, it is what it is, and I sewed my real seams and trimmed and hemmed and everything.

Then, I cheaped out on my neck binding (used a scrap that barely worked instead of cutting a full length piece and testing for ideal length). This taught me a good lesson about how tight bindings really change shapes! I think the crew neck I ended up with actually looks good, neat and tidy. Ironically, it notably improved the upper bust fabric pooling issues as well. But it was supposed to be a more open round neck since I generally find that more comfortable.

So in the end, the only real problem with the shirt is some lack of ease around the neck, shoulders, and arms. Not a big problem with the stretch fabric, just not what I generally prefer to wear most of the time. The tighter fit would be useful for winter warmth and layering though, so I will definitely keep it and wear it.

Did I succeed in my primary goal of learning a lot? YES. Wow, just sewing on my first sleeve, what a disorienting and strange experience!

I am keeping my Bibi pattern bookmarked since I love the body shape from the bust down. It's very simple and just works on me. I would like to make a couple different Bibis using what I learned from this one, maybe a sleeveless/tank top, and a short sleeve T-shirt, which I believe would avoid the shoulder/sleeve fit issues I had with the first one.

I'd also like to try to merge my Bibi's body with the Hugo pattern's raglan sleeve, and see if I can Frankenstein together a mock-up to pin and alter, and maybe turn that mock-up into a pattern or sloper for myself to use for some future long-sleeve tops. I do still want a cozy long-sleeve easy shirt/sweater top that fits me how I like. I think a raglan sleeve would be more forgiving of my narrow forward shoulders, and also easier to sew and alter to my liking.
