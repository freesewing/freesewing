We were floored when a FreeSewing user dropped these fabulous pictures of their new Simon in a GitHub issue. 

The pattern of the blue fabric prompted them to use eight buttons in the front instead of just seven. They were afraid it would look odd otherwise if the buttons were on different parts of the design.

This is the fifth Simon shirt for this sewist, but they sewed the buttonholes on the wrong side. They saved it by sewing another buttonhole placket over it, with a positive side result: the buttonhole placket is now nice and stiff. They're delighted.
