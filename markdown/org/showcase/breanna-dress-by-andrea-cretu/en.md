Andrea added a circle skirt to the Breanna block to make this charming dress. We love the choice of fabric and buttons!

Andrea shared these helpful details:

> Made a dress based on the Breanna body block, with a circle skirt. Next iteration I'll scoop out the armholes and neck and add length to the bottom, so the skirt starts a little lower. Also will make the darts end earlier on the bust and later on the back.
