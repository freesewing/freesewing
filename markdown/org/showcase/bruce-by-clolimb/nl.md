This Bruce was made by CloLimb on GitHub, and has been shared with permission. The wearer says, "It fits so well! ... I made a little tag out of some vintage batik to cover my messy elastic join." We love their fabric and design choices -- what a great looking result. We love their fabric and design choices -- what a great looking result.
