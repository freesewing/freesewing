Victoria's first version of Bruce had some instant fans -- people in the FreeSewing community asked to copy her settings for their own pairs!

She shared her [settings](https://freesewing.org/patterns/fjhan/) so you can make a pair with your measurements.

Victoria said they fit great and that she definitely recommends giving it a try if you already like boyshorts.
