Em made this bomb Carlton coat! They shared a little more info on their make:

> I made this slightly modified version of the Carlton Coat a while back. If i remember correctly I ended up shortening the hem and bringing in the pleats a little in an attempt to get a slightly more femme cut. Fabric is some kind of wool, collars and cuffs are from some cheap mohair scraps I picked up, and it's lined in black silk (it was my first time sewing silk on my machine which was an interesting challenge!). I made a bunch of mistakes but it was a lot of fun! (black-on-black-on-black hides a lot of mistakes 😁 )
