This stellar Carlton coat was made by sewingdentist, who said:

> This year's biggest project: completedðŸ˜Šâœ… Robâ€™s new wintercoat is made from 100% woolen fabric, horse hair interfacing and a cheerful brown lining. I really like the special back of this pattern. This coat has a welt pocket (on the inside), chest pockets and patch pockets with flaps. Absolutely loved this Carlton coat pattern from [@freesewing_org](https://www.instagram.com/freesewing_org/). It is made to measure, you can enter your measurements and it generates a pattern in your size! ðŸ§¥
