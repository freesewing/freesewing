FreeSewing user Zag shared this about their new teeny tiny Hi: "I made an itty bitty Hi (I'm renting so can't fit a full size one 😆), with loads of colours to fit my gender! I did it by hand so I made everything way more difficult for myself, and it was hard doing it so small (20%), but got there in the end."

We think it's incredible!
