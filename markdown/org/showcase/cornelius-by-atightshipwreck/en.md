We dig these Cornelius breeches made by ATightShipwreck! They shared:

> I have finished a pair of Cornelius Breeches. I do believe I added 3 inches of ease for the sake of "this body has hips"

> I used a contrasting fabric for the pocket lining and added belt loops as well (Because I am a modern person with needs)
