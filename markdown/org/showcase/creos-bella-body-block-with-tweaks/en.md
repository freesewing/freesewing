Creo shared their Bella body block in the FreeSewing Discord chat. They made a few adjustments to achieve an excellent fit! Comments on the adjustments:

Here are a few images of the first Bella made straight off the default settings, no alterations (except splitting the front like suggested for easier fitting):
