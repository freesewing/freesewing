We are in love with this gorgeous outfit featuring the Wahid and Benjamin patterns! The maker said:

> My bestie had a white themed wedding... Made a Wahid waistcoat & Benjamin bow tie for myself (trousers & shirt weren't freesewing patterns)! Quite proud & getting ALL the love from the Curvy sewing community group on FB!

Such a great look for what sounds like a fabulous event!
