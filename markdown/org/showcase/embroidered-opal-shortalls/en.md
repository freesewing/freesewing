These are a pair of knee-length shortalls (or overall shorts) made from midweight black denim. All seven available pockets and the hammer loop are included in this Opal, with a large pentagon style chosen for the bib pocket.

The seams are faux flat-felled seams made using contrasting gold-colored thread. The seam allowance is 5/8" and the hem allowance is twice the seam allowance (1 1/4") Both the waistband and the bib placket were made using three folds. The waistband has a width of 2 cm while the bib placket has a width of 3 cm.

Leg length of 44%, strap length of 160%, and strap width or 1 1/2" was used. Eases around the body are around +25%, with a 3.7% crotch drop and +66.8% leg hem ease for shorts-style legs.

The dragonfly, Tyrannosaurus, and Ankylosaurus embroideries are my designs based off of images from the Wikimedia Commons. The butterfly embroidery is from the Inkstitch tutorial. The two Stitches, the autism heart design, and the autism design on the back are not mine.
