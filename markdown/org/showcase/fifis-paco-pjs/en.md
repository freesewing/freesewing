Fifi adjusted the Paco pants pattern to achieve an oft-requested result: FreeSewing PJ pants!

> My new Paco PJs! (Maximum ease for baggy comfort)

Fifi is teaching a beginner course on sewing PJs and says, "These are perfect because they will set up an account at freesewing, learn how to do measurements, learn how to calculate fabric yardage, which you wouldn't really learn much about with big brand sewing patterns." Very cool!
