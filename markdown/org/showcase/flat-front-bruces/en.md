There's well-established precedent that once you make a pair of Bruces you like, you'll end up making tons more of them. FreeSewing  extraordinaire follows in this grand tradition, crafting several Bruces with a flat front for a family member. We love the mix-and-match patterns and contrasting elastic on these awesome undies.
