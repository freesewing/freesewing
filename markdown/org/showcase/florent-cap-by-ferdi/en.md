This refined Florent cap is by Ferdi, who said:

> Florent cap by ferdi for rainy days. Oil skin outside, linen inside. This is my second Florent cap. The first one was a bit too wide, and I'm extremely finicky about headwear (as well as sofas and lamps). I will make another one in linen/linen for summer. Oh, under the jacket it's my Simon shirt.
