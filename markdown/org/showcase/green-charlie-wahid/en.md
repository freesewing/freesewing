Are you kidding?!? This Charlie and Wahid duo is so suave and sophisticated it's ridiculous. Made from a green herringbone shetland wool by [@sewingdentist](https://www.instagram.com/direct/t/101611007905406/sewingdentist) on Instagram, we think it's impeccable. Bonus points for the cool double-breasted modification, which you can see even closer below.
