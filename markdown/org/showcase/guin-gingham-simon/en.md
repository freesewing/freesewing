intro: "Guin made this great modified Simon by giving it fun lantern sleeves in a contrasting color that definitely has nothing to do with running out of navy gingham. All's well that ends well, though - his shirt turned out awesome. Also loving the way the stripe matching turned out across the front."

Guin made this great modified Simon by giving it fun lantern sleeves in a contrasting color that definitely has nothing to do with running out of navy gingham. All's well that ends well, though - his shirt turned out awesome. Also loving the way the stripe matching turned out across the front.
