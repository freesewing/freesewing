Halbmoki's Hi was instantly adored by the FreeSewing community!

The maker shared:

> Both the sewing and the photos are by me. As additional info: It is made at 35% scale and the main material is a printed cotton poplin fabric. Using non-stretch material is probably the main reason for the stretch marks and general lumpiness.
