Gaëlle made this Hugo covered in cheerful little ...well I'm not sure what to call these squiggly little monsters, but they're clearly great. It's for a friend, and we would be delighted to receive something this fabulous.  Check out that awesome coordinated striped ribbing.

While it's hard to describe a smiling blob effectively, know that these ones are stylized cartoons, have one or two eyes, and have the same weird charm of a Squishmallow.](https://posts.freesewing.org/uploads/FS_Hugo_Squirmblies_1_ecacad5e0f.jpeg)

 And it gets better - there's even a bonus one with a blue plush lining in the hood, made for the same person. What a lucky duck!
