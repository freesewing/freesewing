Enamored with this hoodie a FreeSewing user posted in the Discord!

ts made this Hugo with a body from a modded Teagan, and had to make an insert after noticing that the neck opening was too wide. The cuffs, waistband, and drawstring are made from body fabric.

It did turn a laundry load orange early on, but we think it was worth it.
