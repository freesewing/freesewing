intro: "Another amazing FreeSewing make from comixminx, showcasing a great way of solving for a fitting challenge. This kid-sized Hugo hoodie (minus hoodl) turned out a little extra tricky because the proportions didn’t come out quite as expected. So, she made a few adjustments partway through sewing it up (like adding in a sleeve gusset because the sleeves came out very narrow and hard to get into)."

Another amazing FreeSewing make from comixminx, showcasing a great way of solving for a fitting challenge. This kid-sized Hugo hoodie (minus hoodl) turned out a little extra tricky because the proportions didn’t come out quite as expected. So, she made a few adjustments partway through sewing it up (like adding in a sleeve gusset because the sleeves came out very narrow and hard to get into).

This Hugo was designed for a kid, which comixminx noted comes with trade-offs in the fitting process: "Basically, sewing the FS patterns for kids is perhaps not quite an out of the box solution even though it helps with other elements like the fact that it’ll account for how skinny my kid is, and it will give a better range of gender-inclusive patterns in that sizing."
