This Jaeger jacket has all of us at FreeSewing considering how we can work flamingo prints into all of our makes.

Roberta made this for her friend who will wear it at his daughter's wedding.

Roberta shared:

> Fabric from Spoonflower with flamingos in a cotton linen blend is working perfectly for the jacket. I did a mock up and alterations were minimal; just tiny a adjustment on the shoulder. Will send pictures for the finished product to share with you. It is looking spectacular and your draft is brilliant.

This flamingo jacket was shared with us by Roberta Doylend, Head Of Wardrobe at the Marilyn I Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts, Dramatic Arts at Brock University.
