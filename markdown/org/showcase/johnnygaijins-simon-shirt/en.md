Johnnygaijin has already proven themselves quite brave - this was their first sewing project! It turned out great.

They shared some helpful notes:

> I made the Simon shirt.  It was my first real sewing project.  I got a sewing machine for Christmas and figured I'd just jump in the deep end.  The sleeves are touch too long. I figure I'll make another one right away to lock in what I've learned.  
>
> The hardest part was attaching the sleeves. Distributing the sleevecap ease evenly was super difficult and I certainly didn't do a great job. Any tips there would be appreciated. Flat felling the sleeves was beyond my ability too, I ended up just fake serging them with a zigzag stitch. 

FreeSewing is planning some tweaks to the default sleevecap ease and cuff ease based on the helpful feedback. Check out the [latest version of the Simon pattern on FreeSewing.org](https://freesewing.org/designs/simon/).
