Okay, these aren't meant to be worn together as they are for different people, but we couldn't resist putting them together in a Showcase post because... (drumroll please)... They match! These Shin swim trunks and Bee bikini top are made for FreeSewing user JenBarb_'s siblings, which means one more pair and they'll all be able to coordinate!
