The FreeSewing community on Discord has enjoyed following along the journey of these Bruce modifications. Lasermonkey12 graciously shared her highly modified pattern pieces which are shown below.

But wait, there's more!

This shows how she added additional crutch gusset part that allows me to easily put in pads even though the legs are super long. Clever!

Bonus showcase! Here's an even further modified version with front+inset and side+back merged. Only 3 pieces and 4 seams.

Equipped with this knowledge, we hope you'll go out and make a bunch of versions for yourself. Awesome undies for all.
