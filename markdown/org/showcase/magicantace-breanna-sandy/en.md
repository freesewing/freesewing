MagicantAce made this fantastic doll outfit with Breanna and Sandy! He said it was great to be able to use doll measurements on FreeSewing since this doll line has been hard to find patterns for and has a dramatic hourglass shape that makes drafting difficult. We love the results!

Yay for parametric design!
