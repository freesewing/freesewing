We love these awesome, faintly sparkly mermaid scale print Waralees. Maker MagicantAce doesn't usually sew human-sized garments -- be sure to check out his fantastic doll outfits in other FreeSewing showcases -- but did a great job with these. He mentioned that the hardest part was turning the tubes for the ties right side out.
