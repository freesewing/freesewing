intro: "I've made a number of projects based on Freesewing's Noble block, which I love because I find it really flattering for someone with a larger bust. I've made various alterations to it, but this was one of my more complex projects, including corded scallops at the sleeves and neckline."

This dress is one of the most complex things I've sewn, largely due to the (painstakingly annoying!) scallop details along the neckline and sleeves. I experimented with a variety of techniques for the scallops and ended up zigzagging over embroidery thread, using an embroidery hoop and wash-away stabilizer to keep the slippery chiffon in place. The other embroidery on the dress is done with free motion embroidery on embroidery thread, which may not be a real technique but did create an effect I liked, and the flowers are chiffon that I singed at the edges and hand-sewed to the dress with beads for sparkle. For all the work I put in, I'm not sure this dress is my favorite I've made, but I think I may someday add extra length (in a different color, since I'm out of the green) and maybe some more embroidery to give it a bit more elegance.
