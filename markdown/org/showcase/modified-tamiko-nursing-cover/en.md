The maker shared:

> I used the Tamiko as a base to dupe a popular knit nursing cover! My version uses a 95% cotton/5% spandex mesh fabric. I ordered one yard but decided to hem it so I lost a few inches. I skipped most of the sewing (only did "C" as shown in the instructions) because this will be worn as an overlay, not a regular top, and I wanted it to open freely. I actually didn't even sew "C" -- I inserted Kam snaps instead. This was quick and fun to sew.
