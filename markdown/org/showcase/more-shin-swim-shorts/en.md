intro: "comixminx made another fun pair of Shin swim shorts, this time for her younger kid. Even with a test pair (pictured below), the final version was slightly too snug. The wearer of the first pair reported the same feedback. Others who may try Shin for kids may want to take this into account. (They are still being worn in the weekly swimming lessons, however!)"
