These Cornelius trousers are by the talented and prolific Laser. We dig! She shared:

"I didn't check the default waistband height so I had to remove some and I finished it without a waistband so the pockets would work as originally patterned. There's elastic in the center back because it was a little big and I wanted stretch anyway."
