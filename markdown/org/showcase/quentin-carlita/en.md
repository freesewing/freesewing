The talented Quentin made this sleek and stylish Carlita coat.

It was made from a thick wool, found in a destash event, and lined in silk.

He mentioned a few tweaks:
- the back is getting a box pleat above the waist. The seam at the waist will be covered with half belts. Below the waist comes another pleat arrangement (Box pleat with a vent underneath)
- the front is getting vertical welt pockets for holding your hands between chest and waist (offset from the princess seam to reduce bulk and provide a bit more room in the pocket before the front edge and slightly slanted to go with the movement of the hand) and jetted pockets at the waist (instead of patch pockets)
- the front lining gets one jetted pocket, with the narrowest welt I have ever made... pattern matched of course

Here are a few making-of photos. For even more, check out Quentin's Instagram!
