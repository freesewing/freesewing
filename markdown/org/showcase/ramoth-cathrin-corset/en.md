Here's a fantastic butterfly Cathrin corset made by Ramoth - their very first! They shared this about future alterations: 

"I might alter the front to be straighter/flatter next time; I'm not curved there, and the front edge flipped out a little and caught on my desk sometimes. I made this out of scraps (and laced it with a shoelace), so I don't feel too bad that the construction is a bit slapdash."

That being said, we think it looks impeccable!
