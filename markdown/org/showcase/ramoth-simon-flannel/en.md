Ramoth made this stunning upsized Simon for a cozy fall flannel. They increased the ease generally, and added a sleeve gusset to account for a fitting challenge. The stock version of the sleeves tend to pull tight at the shoulder/bicep when they moved their arms, but as you can see, the gusset solved that!

They're still having trouble with the collar ease -- even at the max, it's a bit tight. For the next round, Ramoth's planning to fudge my neck measurement a bit to help with that.

And to wrap things up, this from Ramoth about using FreeSewing patterns: "Love that I am able to get patterns that I don't have to shorten through the torso, though -- that's absolutely my favorite thing about freesewing!"
