Where to start with this fantastic outfit? A FreeSewing user said it best:
> I can't stop looking at the pictures because you're just INCREDIBLE :star_struck: the posing, the colour coordination down to shoes socks and watch, everything just absolutely brilliant, the Simon with that collar is such a good look!

We love this "vintage high fashion" version of Simon and Sandy by RedBlaqueGolden, who omitted the standard Simon collar and opted for a mandarin style collar instead.
