This linen Wahid waistcoat was made for a 1-year-old toddler. It is made of linen and was made fully reversible following a tutorial by Sarah Kirsten: [How to Sew a Lined Vest - Two Easy Methods](https://sarkirsten.com/blog/2018/9/22/omuy047cpuvy6vy86m9e83caymfyae)

The maker bumped up the chest (8%), waist (12%), and hips (12%) ease and reports she will increase the ease for the next one even more so that it can be worn longer. She also decreased the length bonus to 0% to allow the pattern pieces to each fit on one printed page.

The outfit also features the Pythia paenula, a not-yet-published cloak pattern.
