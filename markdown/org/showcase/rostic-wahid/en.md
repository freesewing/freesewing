Rostic made this great Wahid waistcoat! You won't want to miss the detail pictures below.

They shared:

> wahid pattern worked out great for me! used some 1975 laura ashley floral cotton from my mum's collection and an old bed sheet for lining

> I used the pattern to my measurements without any adjustments, it is a very good fit but I can still squeeze another layer underneath for warmth. I used the instructions for some of the assembly but not all - I assembled the outer layer and lining separately including the shoulder seams while leaving the side seams open. Then I sewed outside to lining at the armscye right sides together to have a clean finished edge that's easy to press at the shoulder. Next I sewed side seams right sides together; lining and outer layer form one long continuous side seam. Lastly I did the edges all the way around in two parts with what I've seen called the "burrito roll" technique.

> For finishing I added pick stitching around all the edges (somewhat visible in one of the detail pictures showing the inside) and closures.

> I didn't end up interfacing the full front since I didn't have enough on hand, but I think the materials are a good weight on their own. The outer floral fabric is a heavier 1970s Laura Ashley cotton. The lining is old bed sheet in an unobtrusive muted blue.
