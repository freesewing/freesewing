This lovely Sandy skirt was made by Sunshine. The maker shared more information about the project:

"I couldn't fit the Sandy pattern on the 44"fabric I bought, so I ended up folding it a few times and using it to cut sections for a panel skirt using alternating colors instead that I had dyed last week. I added a strip on the bottom to increase the length. Then, I added a  trim that I had sitting in my sewing basket for 2 years. I hadn't previously considered using a section of the Sandy as a panel segment, but it worked super well!!! I'm not perfect at sewing, but I think it turned out alright!"
