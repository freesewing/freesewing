These Shin swim shorts were a labor of love -- comixminx made several test pairs in stretchy fabric to refine the fit. She shared lots of tips on [Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/) along the way. A couple key ones:
- A microtex needle worked very well on these fabrics
- As drafted for the recipient's measurements, the crotch was too angular; smoothing out that seam made it more comfortable
- A fake coverlock stitch looked great from the outside, but may have reduced comfort -- make sure you think about the wearer's comfort for each seam of this pattern

We think the final product looks great!
