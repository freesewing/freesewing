What an attractive version of the Simon shirt! The maker says:

> My third Simon shirt, this time as an overshirt, which I therefore made a little wider (well, at the shoulders it has become a little too wide). The fabric is 60/40% merino wool / cordura - very comfy. On the left is a small zipper pocket inserted. I wear it both hiking and in the office.
