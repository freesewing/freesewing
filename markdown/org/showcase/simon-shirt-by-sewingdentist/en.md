sewingdentist is back with more great work, this time a Simon shirt. They shared:

> Party!ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ‰ I made this shirt a while ago for Rob and used the Simon shirt by @freesewing_org, which you can draft to your own measurements and with a lot of options. Rob wanted a seamless style button and buttenhole placket, chamfer barrel cuffs and back darts. I will use this pattern again! Only adjustment I did: extra room in the cuffs for a watch.
