We were all rather impressed with Solstice's first Simon shirt -- joost in particular now has "shirt-envy."

Solstice shared some helpful comments that will be incorporated into future adjustments to Simon:

> There are a couple fit issues but I'm finding ways around them so I can still wear the shirt. The hem hits at my high hip, which is too short for most of my trousers, but I have a pair that goes to my natural waist so I wear it with those. I think I'll close up the arms a little bit because the cuff openings currently go all the way to my elbows and it's a little uncomfortable. Also the neck is probably 0.5-1in too narrow for my comfort, so I style it in ways that allow me to leave the top button or two open to keep it comfortable. Oh! And I adjusted the armscye as I was sewing it because the shape was a bit off. I still love the shirt though, and I can adjust those things on my next one. Mostly I'm happy to have a shirt pattern that started with the right measurements!
