A FreeSewing user gave modifying Teagan a try, and we love how the results turned out! Here's a little explanation she shared of how she drafted her Teagan and shaped the side seams for a closer fit.

"I'm really happy with how this turned out! I was curious to see how a close-fitting made-to-measure t-shirt would look on me, so I gave Teagan a try. I set both chest and hips ease as low as they would go (5% and 8%, respectively) and added some bonus length to both the shirt itself and the sleeves.

For a tighter fit at the top I enabled 'draft for high bust'. There was no option to set the waist ease (yet), so I combined two versions, one generated as usual and one where I replaced my hips measurement with my waist measurement.

The neckband is just a (horizontal) strip of the same fabric, attached as a knit band.

I was surprised by how quickly this came together, and I can definitely see myself making several of these in different fabrics!"
