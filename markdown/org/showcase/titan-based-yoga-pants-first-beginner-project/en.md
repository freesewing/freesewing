I am a total beginner when it comes to garment sewing, though I've done some other sewing like quilts and baby stuff. Making a super basic pair of lounge pants off the Titan block was my first clothing project. My goals were:
1. create a pair of pants I could wear around the house
2. learn about fitting pants to my body properly
3. learn about working with stretch fabric

The result meet all these goals and more. They are now one of my favorite cozy pants!

When generating my pattern I dove deep into the design options. I added a bunch of extra length, height, ease, largest possible seam allowance, etc at this stage to make sure I had something to work with. I looked closely at my best fitting jeans and so I had some idea of the kind of shapes I wanted to see in the pattern. Luckily the Titan pattern I came up with looked reasonably close (wider and more rounded back piece, straight and more narrow front piece, similar high-waisted straight leg silhouette).

I used a medium weight stretch fabric - smooth on the right side, baby french terry on the wrong side, and quite a bit of 2-way stretch. Despite the stretch factor, I wanted the pants to mostly fit with a bit of ease - "skim the body" type fit - since I generally don't prefer the sensation of tight clothing. And, to leave growing room for weight fluctuations.

When sewing the pattern, first I did all the seams using a very long, loose zigzag stitch to baste - just enough to hold them together for awhile, but easy to rip out. Then I tried the pants on and did a few rounds of alteration and re-basting.

Once the pants seemed to fit well and looked quite good to me in the mirror, I examined my final alterations and drew in pink on the paper pattern where I'd changed the seam lines. I took in the back waist where it was gapping, and removed a bunch of excessive crotch ease.

I trimmed some of my excess fabric and removed old basting as needed, then sewed my real seams (close, narrow zigzag) over my final basted seams. The basting made the sewing really easy in this step, and I'm sure my final seams are much smoother than they would have been otherwise. I trimmed the excess allowance from the seams as I went. Then I finished with a wide foldover yoga-pants-style waistband way up at my natural waist, and hemmed the bottoms.

Only later did I have my someone else take photos from all sides including behind, and I noticed the fit from behind was not as good as from the front. My alterations had taken too much length out of the back rise/back cross seam, with the center-back cross seam noticeably dipping down where it met the waistband. And yet STILL there was wrinkly pooled fabric sagging under my bottom. This was not noticeable when I was twisting around to see myself in the mirror. It's a little nitpicky, a lot of pants off the rack fit me like this too and I wear them like that - but I wanted my best fit, so I spent some time reading more about full seat pants alterations.

After some research and thinking about it and staring at the pattern pieces, I came up with two small adjustments to the back piece that theoretically should improve things. I drew those on my paper pattern in blue. First, some redrawing of the crotch point of the back panel to add more back rise while simultaneously removing some excess upper thigh ease, with a smooth consistent shape. Second, angling the back waist seam upwards in the middle to add some more rise length and even out the waistline in the back, while maintaining the same waist circumference.

I am going to save this marked up paper pattern of Titan. My first pair of pants are already great lounge pants, but I think my next pair will be even better! Once I test this blue marked up pattern, if it works as well as I hope and dream, I will turn it into a sloper on posterboard or some other similar medium. Making a basic pair of pants from Titan also taught me a lot that will help me alter existing pants to fit me better.
