This was my first Freesewing make, and I'm really pleased with how they came out!
They were presents for two friends and my first time sewing with this kind of fabric. It was 'cuddle fleece' with a one way stretch and fur a little bit longer than the original Bl√•haj. 

As happy as I am with them, I did not enjoy sewing these. I printed my copy without seam allowance cause I come from a hand sewing background and that's what I'm used to, but it was definitely a mistake when using black fur since marking out the stitch lines was a nightmare when preparing the striped pieces. Fluffy fabric brings its own challenges and I could have made it a lot easier for myself. 

They came out as good as I had hoped and the pattern was really simple to follow (especially if you don't impose setbacks on yourself) and the recipients were overjoyed with their enbyhajs!
