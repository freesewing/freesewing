The maker added a waistband to Ursula for this reversible two-piece swimsuit. She said, "Ursula is so versatile and fun!" We think it turned out amazing!

She shared the design so that others can generate the exact same design (adapted to their own measurements): [https://freesewing.org/patterns/feaxz/](https://freesewing.org/patterns/feaxz/)
