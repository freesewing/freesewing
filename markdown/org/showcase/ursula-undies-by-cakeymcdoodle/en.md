cakeymcdoodle made these delightful Ursula undies! She shared:

> I'm about to make lots and lots of underwear, so I'm testing the Ursula pattern. This is low rise, high cut at the front, full coverage at the back and a bit of an anterior pelvic tilt adjustment. They already fit a million times better than any RTW pants I've ever had. My plan is to make lots of jersey, lace, and period knickers, then when I've made all the practical ones I'll do some thongs. I think I will have a whole drawer full by the end
