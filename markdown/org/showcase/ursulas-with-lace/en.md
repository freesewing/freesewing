We love the fabric and elastic choices on Sanne's first two pairs of Ursulas! FreeSewing contributors in Discord said they loved the lace and the color combos.

The first pair was a little big, so her next version increased the *fabric stretch* percentage option a bit. A good guideline might be:

* fabric stretch < 30% --> shrink pattern by stretch - 15
* fabric stretch > 30% --> shrink pattern by stretch/2
