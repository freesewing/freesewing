Pho made this stellar Wahid! They shared:

> Wahid to my measurements. I opted out of buttons since I sit a lot at work and a completely fitted garment for me wouldn't be able to stay buttoned. I also did the pocket bags as one long piece of fabric which was easiest for me to understand under guidance of a sewing teacher.  I might opt for snaps or just leave it open. My size stomach wise is bigger than my chest. Amazing how a garment my size makes me look great! Thanks for the pattern!
