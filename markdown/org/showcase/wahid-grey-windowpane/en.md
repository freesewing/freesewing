This FreeSewing user finished their first Wahid waistcoat, and it turned out great! 

They had this to share about the experience: "Definitely was out of practice but worked out smoother than expected and in a lot less time. In the end Iâ€™m slightly unhappy with the arm holes and the button holes, but the result is solid. My interfacing also likely was way too strong, resulting in a weird front panel with unfortunate wrinkles."
