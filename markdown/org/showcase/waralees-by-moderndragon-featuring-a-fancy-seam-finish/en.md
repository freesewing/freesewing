This was moderndragon's very first Waralee wrap pants!

They also tried their hand at a fancy seam finish for the crotch seam. Which was a bit of a challenge, given that it's a really curved seam. But they think it was worth it.

Can you believe they created this vibrant fabric by dyeing an old duvet cover?

Lovely work!
