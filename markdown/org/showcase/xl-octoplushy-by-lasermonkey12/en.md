Not sure what to do with your scraps? Let us introduce the best idea ever: an XL Octoplushy. This was made by lasermonkey12 who shared on [Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/) and granted us permission to repost here. She notes that this Octoplushy is stuffed with scraps and is not full yet, thus the zipper.
