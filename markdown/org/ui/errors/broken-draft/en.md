##### Help us make FreeSewing better by reporting this crash

We'd like to gather diagnostics
and [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/new) to
investigate what exactly went wrong.

The diagnostics data we collect includes:

-   Your userid
-   Your Github username (only if you configured it in your profile)
-   The pattern name and version
-   The full set of measurements and options used to create this pattern

If you consent to publish this data in the crash report, click the button below.

If not, you can always [report this manually](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/new).
