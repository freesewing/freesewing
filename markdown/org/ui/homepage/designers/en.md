#### What is parametric design?

Parametric design refers to the use of parameters or variables to manipulate the outcome
of a given design within its rules.

In sewing patterns, the *parameters* are what is provided by the user: Their measurements 
and options that they have selected.  
The *rules* of the design are what you, the designer, make them.

#### What does that mean for designers?

When drafting or designing patterns or garments, it is common practice to start with a *fit model*
(or *dress form*). The measurements of the fit model are used as input in the initial design.

Adapting the pattern for a different model is a tedious task, which is why patterns are graded
up and down to cover different sizes.

But in a parametric sewing pattern, adapting to different sizes or models *just works*.
