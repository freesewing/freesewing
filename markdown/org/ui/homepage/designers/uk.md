#### What is parametric design?

Parametric design refers to the use of parameters or variables to manipulate the outcome of a given design within its rules.

In sewing patterns, the _parameters_ are what is provided by the user: Their measurements and options that they have selected.  
The _rules_ of the design are what you, the designer, make them.

#### What does that mean for designers?

When drafting or designing patterns or garments, it is common practice to start with a _fit model_ (or _dress form_). The measurements of the fit model are used as input in the initial design.

Adapting the pattern for a different model is a tedious task, which is why patterns are graded up and down to cover different sizes.

But in a parametric sewing pattern, adapting to different sizes or models _just works_.
