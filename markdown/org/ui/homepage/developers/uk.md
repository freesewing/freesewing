#### Curious how this works?

FreeSewing is written in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). Our [core library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@freesewing/core) and [patterns](/patterns) are available both for [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and the browser.

Our websites are built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/) and kindly hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Everything runs in the browser except user data and conversion to PDF. For that, we have built a backend with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) exposing a REST API.

Our code and markdown content is hosted by [Github](https://github.com/freesewing/). We use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) for translations, search is handled by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) and [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) does error handling for us.

We are appreciative of these and other projects/companies that allow us to stand on their shoulders.

Our [developer documentation](https://freesewing.dev) is available on [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev). You'll find tutorials, how-to guides, as well as our API reference documentation.
