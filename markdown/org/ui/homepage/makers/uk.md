#### Sewing patterns made to your measurements

All our patterns are _made-to-measure_. Not just graded up or down, but actually drafted to your exact specifications, just as you would on paper.

#### Packed with options plus live preview

FreeSewing patterns come with options that allow you to customize different aspects of the pattern. Our live preview means no surprises: what you see is what you get.

#### Patterns you can share and adapt

FreeSewing patterns often have so many options that one pattern can yield a variety of styles. You can share your patterns with others so they can get the same style, drafted to their measurements.

#### A community of helpful people

Questions about a pattern? Stuck on one of the steps when making your garment? No worries, help is available.
