# FreeSewing / backend

This is the backend for [FreeSewing.org](https://freesewing.org/), our maker site.

Our backend is a REST API built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/), 
using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as our database.

This API is required if you want to use your own instance 
of [freesewing.org](https://github.com/freesewing/backend), 
in which case you have two ways to do so:

## Run with docker

### Using docker-compose

You can use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to spin up both the backend
API and a mongo instance. Clone this repository, and then run:

```
docker-compose up
```

Your backend will now be available at http://localhost:3000

### Using our docker image and your own database

If you just want the backend and provide your own mongo instance, 
you can run [our docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/freesewing/backend) directly
from the internet:

```
docker run --env-file .env --name fs_backend -d -p 3000:3000 freesewing/backend
```

Your backend will now be available at http://localhost:3000
  
## Run from source

To run the backend from source, you'll need to clone this repository 
and intall dependencies. 

```
git clone git@github.com:freesewing/backend
cd backend
npm install
npm install --global backpack-core
```

> Note that we're installing [backpack-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backpack-core) globally for ease-of-use

While developing, you can run:

```
npm run develop
```

And backpack will compile the backend, and spin it up.
It will also watch for changes and re-compile every time. Handy!

If you want to run this in production, you should build the code:

```
npm run build
```

Then use something like [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to run it and keep it running.

## Configuration

This backend can be configured with environment variables. They are detailed below.

> **Note:**
>
> If you're using docker (or docker-compose) you can use an environment file.  
> If you're running from source, you need to set these manually, or via a script.
