### About

Project 2022 is an initiative (started by Joost) to give FreeSewing a new face.
Specifically, the aim is to build new freesewing.dev and freesewing.org websites
that are better/faster/more intuitive than what we currently have.

It's named **2022** to manage expectations for when it will be ready ðŸ˜„

### Goals

- Switch from GatsbyJS to **NextJS** as our framework
- Reduce build-time and make it easier for changes to be rolled out in production
- Use **TailwindCSS** for styling, and remove \`@freesewing/css-theme\` as a dependency
- Remove the \`@material-ui\` component library as a dependency, and use native elements & CSS where possible to reduce the Javascript bundle size
- Bring the code for both websites into our monorepo &
  enable code sharing between sites without the need to publish NPM packages
- Bring our markdown content into our monorepo
- Bundle all translation into a single translation project on Crowdin
- Provide a better search experience
- Use a headless CMS for blog posts and other content that has little reason to be kept in git &
  limit the size of the monorepo
- Make things pretty and themeable
- Improve support on mobile
- Involve the community to work on some of the pain-points of the current site(s)
