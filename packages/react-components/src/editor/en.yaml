expandIsOn.t: This design can save space (and trees)
expandIsOn.d: "Because the **expand** core setting is currently enabled, all parts are fully drawn. You can display this design in a more compact way by disabling the **expand** setting. \n\nDoing so will mean that some parts are not fully drawn or not shown at all. Typically, these are simple rectangles that only take up space, or things that can be cut on the fold."
