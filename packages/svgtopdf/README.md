## What am I looking at? 🤔

This repository holds a stand-alone backend API to turn SVG patterns into (tiled) PDFs.

Our end-goal is to handle this client-side, and have freesewing render to PDF directly.
However, given the complexities of the PDF format, this is non-trivial, so for the time
being we handle this with this backend.

## About FreeSewing 💀

Where the world of makers and developers collide, that's where you'll find FreeSewing.

Our [core library](https://freesewing.dev/) is a *batteries-included* toolbox
for parametric design of sewing patterns. It's a modular system (check our list
of [plugins](https://freesewing.dev/plugins) and getting started is as simple as:

```bash
npm init freesewing-pattern
```

We also have [a template repository](https://github.com/freesewing/pattern) if you prefer to start that way.

Developer documentation is maintained on [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/) and
we also have a `#development-help` channel on [Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/).

If you're a maker, checkout [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/) where you can generate
our sewing patterns adapted to your measurements.
