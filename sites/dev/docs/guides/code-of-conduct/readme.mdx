## Our pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the FreeSewing community pledge
to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability,
ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

##  Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action
in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons
for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all FreeSewing community spaces and also applies
when an individual is officially representing the FreeSewing community in public spaces.

Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative
at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement:

- Joost De Cock (joost@joost.at)
- Sorcha Ní Dhubhghaill (nidhubhs@gmail.com)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and
security of the reporter of any incident.
