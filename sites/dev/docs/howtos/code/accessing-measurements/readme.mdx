title: Accessing measurements
---

[Measurements](/reference/measurements) are available on the `measurements` key of from the object passed
to your part's draft method. You can destructure them for easy access.

```design/src/part.mjs
function draftPart = ({
  // highlight-start
  measurements,
  // highlight-end
  part
}) {

  const a = measurements.chest
  const b = measurements['hips']

  return part
}
```

:::note

Keep in mind that [FreeSewing uses millimeter for everything](/guides/prerequisites#units).
