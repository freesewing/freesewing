title: Using macros
---

Macros are a way to facilitate pattern design by bundling a bunch of individual
actions into a little routine. Macros are provided 
by [plugins](/reference/plugins/).

Refer to the [macros documentation](/reference/macros/) for details on how to
use macros, and the [plugins](/reference/plugins/) documentation for info on
how to create your own macros.
