Our [chatrooms on Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/) are the best place to
ask questions or share your feedback.

Many of the FreeSewing contributors hang out there, and since we're spread over
different parts of the world, you're likely to find somebody there who can answer
your question(s) at any given moment.
