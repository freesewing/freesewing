title: Extending options
---

Additional, optional information can be added to options to extend
their use outside of core functionality.
This can be useful when using FreeSewing through a frontend UI.
The extended information can be used by the frontend to affect
how options are presented.


## Add menu structure

Because FreeSewing designs have been written with the expectation that
they will be used primarily through the freesewing.org website,
their options have been extended with menu information.

```js
options: {
  // Fit
  waistEase: { pct: 2, min: 0, max: 10, menu: 'fit', order: '100' },
  seatEase: { pct: 5, min: 0, max: 15, menu: 'fit', order: '200' },
  // Style
  waistHeight: { pct: 5, min: 0, max: 100, menu: 'style', order: '400' },
  lengthBonus: { pct: 0, min: -15, max: 10, menu: 'style', order: '300' },
  elasticatedCuff: { bool: true, menu: 'style' },
  buttons = { count: 7, min: 4, max: 12, menu: 'style.closure', order: '800' }
  extraTopButton = { bool: true, menu: 'style.closure', order: '850' }
}
```

In the above example, the added `menu` attributes provide the
freesewing.org website UI with information about the options
should appear in menus.
- The `waistEase` and `seatEase` options should appear in the `fit`
menu while the other options go in the `style` menu.
- Additionally, the `buttons` and `extraTopButton` options should
appear in a `closure` submenu under the `style` menu.

The optional 'order' attributes provide the UI with information about
the order in which options and menus should appear.
- Within the `fit` menu, `waistEase` should come before `seatEase`.
- Within the `style` menu, options should be in the order
`lengthBonus`, `waistHeight`, `buttons`, `extraTopButton`, and
`elasticatedCuff`.
- The `elasticatedCuff` option does not have an `order` attribute,
so it should appear after the options that do.
- Because the `fit` menu has an option with an `order` value that comes
before any of the `order` values for options in the `style` menu,
the `fit` menu should appear before the `style` menu.

##### This is not a core feature

To be clear, setting this here does not do anything in core.
It's merely extra metadata you can add on the option to facilitate
frontend integration.

freesewing.org UI behavior:
- Ordering is performed using an alphabetic, not numeric, sort.
For example, `order` value "99" will be placed _after_ "100" because
"1" comes before "9" alphabetically.
However, "099" will be placed before "100", so using leading zeros
can be helpful when using numbers as `order` values.
- After they have been ordered using `order` attribute, if present,
design options and menus are arranged in alphabetical order by
their names.
- However, the `advanced` menu, if present, is always ordered to
be the last menu, appearing after all the other menus.

## Suppress translation

When using `list` options, we usually we want the different options
in the list to be translated.
But sometimes, there is no need for that, like in this example from Breanna:

```js
options: {
  primaryBustDart: {
    list: [
      '06:00',
      '07:00',
      '08:00',
      '09:00',
      '10:00',
      '11:00',
      '11:30',
      '12:00',
      '12:30',
      '13:00',
      '13:30',
      '14:00',
      '15:00',
      '16:00',
      '17:00',
    ],
    dflt: '06:00',
    doNotTranslate: true,
  },
  // More here
}
```

As you can see above, you can set the `doNotTranslate` property to `true` and to indicate this.
