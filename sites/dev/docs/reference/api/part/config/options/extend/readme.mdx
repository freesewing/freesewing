title: Extending options

Additional, optional information can be added to options to extend
their use outside of core functionality.
This can be useful when using FreeSewing through a frontend UI.
The extended information can be used by the frontend to affect
how options are presented.

## Add menu structure

Because FreeSewing designs have been written with the expectation that
they will be used primarily through the freesewing.org website,
their options have been extended with menu information.

Example:

```js
options: {
  // Fit
  waistEase: { pct: 2, min: 0, max: 10, menu: 'fit', order: '100' },
  seatEase: { pct: 5, min: 0, max: 15, menu: 'fit', order: '200' },
  // Style
  waistHeight: { pct: 5, min: 0, max: 100, menu: 'style', order: '400' },
  lengthBonus: { pct: 0, min: -15, max: 10, menu: 'style', order: '300' },
  // Style -> Closure
  elasticatedCuff: { bool: true, menu: 'style' },
  buttons = { count: 7, min: 4, max: 12, menu: 'style.closure', order: '800' },
  extraTopButton = { bool: true, menu: 'style.closure', order: '850' },

  // Conditional menu item
  specialTopButton = {
    bool: false,
    menu: (settings, mergedOptions) =>
      (mergedOptions?.extraTopButton ? 'style.closure' : false),
    order: '860' },
}
```

### The `menu` property

The optional `menu` property provides the freesewing.org website UI
with information about the menu in which the option should appear.

#### Regular menus

If the `menu` property is a string, its value is used as the name of the menu.

- Period characters in the string are delimiters that indicate submenus.
- If there is no `menu` property or if it is set to `false`,
  the option will not appear in the UI menus.
- In the example above:
  - The `waistEase` option appears in the "fit" menu, and `waistHeight`
    appears in the "style" menu.
  - The `buttons` and `extraTopButton` options appear in the "closure"
    submenu under the "style" menu.

#### Conditional menus

If the `menu` property is a function, the UI will evaluate the
function to determine the value of the property.

- If the result of the function is a string, that will be the menu
  in which the option appears.
- If the result of the function is `false`, then the option will
  not appear in the UI menus.
- In the example above:
  - The `specialTopButton` option appears in the "closure" submenu under
    the "style" menu if the `extraTopButton` option is set to `true`.
  - The `specialTopbutton` option does not appear in the UI menus if
    `extraTopButton` is set to `false`.

The function should have the following signature:

```js
function menu(settings, mergedOptions) {
  // return value here
}
```

The first parameter holds the pattern's [settings](/reference/settings) object
which holds -- among other things -- the measurements provided by the user.

The second parameter holds the return value of
[utils.mergeOptions()](/reference/api/utils/mergeoptions),
which provides an object with all option values populated.
Although this parameter is not required for simple values based on
measurements, it is often required when the result depends on several options.

##### This is not a core feature

To be clear, setting this here does not do anything in core.
It's merely extra metadata you can add on the option to facilitate
frontend integration.

### The `order` property

The optional 'order' property provides the UI with information about
the order in which options and menus should appear.

- The `order` property value is used as the sort key.
- Ordering is performed using an alphabetic, not numeric, sort.
  For example, `order` value "99" will be placed _after_ "100" because
  "1" comes before "9" alphabetically.
  However, "099" will be placed before "100", so using leading zeros
  can be helpful when using numbers as `order` values.
- After they have been ordered using `order` attribute, if present,
  design options and menus are arranged in alphabetical order by
  their names.
- The `advanced` menu, if present, is always ordered to
  be the last menu, appearing after all other menus.
- In the example above:
  - Within the "fit" menu, `waistEase` appears `seatEase`.
  - Within the "style" menu, options should be in the order
    `lengthBonus`, `waistHeight`, `buttons`, `extraTopButton`, and
    `elasticatedCuff`.
  - The `elasticatedCuff` option does not have an `order` attribute,
    so it appears after the options that do.
  - Because the "fit" menu has an option with an `order` value that comes
    before any of the `order` values for options in the "style" menu,
    the "fit" menu appears before the "style" menu.

## Suppress translation

When using `list` options, we usually we want the different options
in the list to be translated.
But sometimes, there is no need for that, like in this example from Breanna:

```js
options: {
  primaryBustDart: {
    list: [
      '06:00',
      '07:00',
      '08:00',
      '09:00',
      '10:00',
      '11:00',
      '11:30',
      '12:00',
      '12:30',
      '13:00',
      '13:30',
      '14:00',
      '15:00',
      '16:00',
      '17:00',
    ],
    dflt: '06:00',
    doNotTranslate: true,
  },
  // More here
}
```

As you can see above, you can set the `doNotTranslate` property to `true` and to indicate this.
