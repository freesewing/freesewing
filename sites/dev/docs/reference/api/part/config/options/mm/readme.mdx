title: Millimeter options
---

:::warning

While FreeSewing supports millimeter options, we recommend
using [percentage options][1]. While there are [good
reasons](#when) to use millimeter options, we may reject
contributions that (ab)use them outside of a valid use case.

:::

## Structure

A millimeter option should be a plain object with these properties:

- `mm` : The default value in millimeters
- `min` : The minimum that's allowed
- `max` : The maximum that's allowed

## Example

```js
options: {
  elasticWidth: {
    mm:  35,
    min:  5,
    max: 80
  }
}
```

#### What's wrong with millimeter options?

Millimeter options do not scale.
Parametric design is the _raison d'Ãªtre_ of FreeSewing and that core belief
that things should seamlessly adapt goes out the window when you use a `mm`
option because now you have a value that will not change based on the
input measurements.

When you need a millimeter option, reach for a [snapped
percentage option][1] instead.

#### When to use millimeter options?

There are some use-cases where a millimeter option makes sense.
This is not an exhaustive list, so use your own judgement.

###### When the option is a de-facto measurement {#when}

When an option functions as a de-facto measurement, you should use a millimeter
option. For example, when you are designing a tent pattern, the length of the
tent makes perfect sense as a millimeter option as FreeSewing does not have a
_length-of-tent_ measurements, and adding one does not make a lot of sense.
