title: 'Path._curve()'
---

The `Path._curve()` method draws a cubic BÃ©zier curve
from the current position via two control points to a given endpoint.
However, the start control point is identical to the current position,
so you do not need to provide it.

## Signature

```js
Path path._curve(Point cp2, Point to)
```

:::tip
This method is chainable as it returns the `Path` object
:::

## Example

<Example caption="Example of the Path.\_curve() method">
```js
({ Point, points, Path, paths, part }) => {

points.from = new Point(5, 20)
points.cp2 = new Point(60, 50)
points.to = new Point(90, 20)

paths.line = new Path()
.move(points.from)
.\_curve(points.cp2, points.to)
.setText("Path.\_curve()", "text-sm center fill-note")
.attr("data-text-dy", -1)

return part
}

````
</Example>


## Notes

The main purpose of this method is to save your some typing,
as the two following calls yield the same result:

```js
path.curve(point1, point1, point2)
path._curve(point1, point2)
````
