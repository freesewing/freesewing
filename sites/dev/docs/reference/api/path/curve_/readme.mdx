title: Path.curve_()
---

The `Path.curve_()` method draws a cubic BÃ©zier curve from the current position
via two control points to a given endpoint. However, the end control point is
identical to the end point.

## Signature

```js
Path path.curve_(Point cp1, Point to)
```

:::tip
This method is chainable as it returns the `Path` object
:::

## Example

<Example caption="Example of the Path.curve\_() method">

```js
;({ Point, points, Path, paths, part }) => {
  points.from = new Point(10, 20)
  points.cp1 = new Point(40, 0)
  points.to = new Point(90, 20)

  paths.line = new Path()
    .move(points.from)
    .curve_(points.cp1, points.to)
    .setText('Path.curve_()', 'text-sm center fill-note')
    .attr('data-text-dy', -1)

  return part
}
```

</Example>

## Notes

The main purpose of this method is to save your some typing,
as the two following calls yield the same result:

```js
.curve(point1, point2, point2)
.curve_(point1, point2)
```
