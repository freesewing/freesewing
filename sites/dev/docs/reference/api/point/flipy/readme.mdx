title: Point.flipY()
---

The `Point.flipY()` method returns a new `Point` that mirrors the original
point around the Y-value of the point you pass it.  If you do not pass in a
point, it will default to mirroring around an Y-value of zero.

## Signature

```js
Point point.flipY(Point mirror = false)
```

## Example
