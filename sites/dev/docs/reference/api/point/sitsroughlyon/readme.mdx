title: Point.sitsRoughlyOn()
---

The `Point.sitsRoughlyOn()` method returns `true` if this point has roughly
(rounded to the nearest millimeter) the same coordinates as the one you pass to
it.

## Signature

```js
bool point.sitsRoughlyOn(Point check)
```

## Example

<Example caption="An example of the Point.sitsRoughlyOn() method">
```js
({ Point, points, Path, paths, Snippet, snippets, part }) => {

  let s
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    points[`a${i}`] = new Point(i * 10, 40)
    points[`b${i}`] = new Point(i * 10, i * 8)
    if (points[`a${i}`].sitsRoughlyOn(points[`b${i}`])) s = "notch"
    else s = "bnotch"
    snippets[`b${i}`] = new Snippet(s, points[`b${i}`])
    snippets[`a${i}`] = new Snippet(s, points[`a${i}`])
  }

  // Prevent clipping
  paths.diag = new Path()
    .move(new Point(0,0))
    .move(new Point(90,70))

  return part
}
```
</Example>


## Notes

The difference between this method and
[`Point.sitsOn()`](/reference/api/point/sitson/) is that this one rounds things
down to the nearest integer (thus mm) before checking.
