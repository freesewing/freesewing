The `Store.push()` method adds the parameters you pass it to the array stored under `key`.

If `key` does not hold and Array, the Store will log a warning, but nothing will happen.

## Signature

Store store.push(mixed value1, mixed value2, ...)
```

## Example

```js
const store = new Store()
store.set('example', ['Hi there'])
store.push('How are you doing', 'How are YOU doing')
```
