The `Svg` object in FreeSewing's core library represents an SVG document.
It is not directly exposed, but it is available as the `svg` attribute
of a [Pattern object](/reference/api/pattern/).

While the methods exposed by this object are only used internally,
its attributes are useful for situations where you
want to develop a plugin, or use a custom layout.
