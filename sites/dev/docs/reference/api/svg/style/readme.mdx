title: Svg.style
---

The `Svg.style` property holds a string that will be rendered as the style
section of the SVG document.

## Signature

```svg
<style type="text/css">
  /* svg.style will be inserted */
</style>
```

## Notes

The style property is where plugins will add additional styling.

When adding your own styles, it's important not to
overwrite this property, but rather add your own.

In other words, do this:

```js
svg.style += myStyles
```

and don't do this:

```js
svg.style = myStyles
```
