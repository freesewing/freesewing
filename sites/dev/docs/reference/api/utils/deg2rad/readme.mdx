title: utils.deg2rad()
---

The `utils.deg2read()` function returns the degrees you pass to it as radians.

## Signature

```js
float utils.deg2rad(float degrees)
```

## Notes

This is useful for when you use functions like `Math.cos()` that expect a corner
in radians, when we typically use degrees.
