title: postRender
---

The `postRender` lifecycle hook is triggered after the SVG is rendered.
It will only fire when `Pattern.render()` is called.

## Signature

```js
null hook(Svg svg)
```

## Notes

The `postRender` hook is rarely used, but it's there if you need it.

Like the `preRender` hook, it receives [the SVG object](/reference/api/svg) as its first
parameter.
