title: preDraft
---

The `preDraft` lifecycle hook runs just before your pattern is drafted.

## Signature

```js
null hook(Pattern pattern)
```

## Example

```js
pattern.on('preDraft', pattern => {
  // Mutate the pattern object here
}
```

## Notes

The `preDraft` hook fires once for all the sets in the pattern.
While typically, there is only one set, there might be more. 
In that case, the [`preSetDraft` lifecycle hook](/reference/hooks/presetdraft) is
the per-set equivalent of this hook.
