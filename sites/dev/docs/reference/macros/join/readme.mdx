title: join
---

The `join` macro joins multiple paths together.

Unlike the core `path.join(...)` function, the `join` macro can extend line ends to meet in a sharp corner and will automatically
trim useless path ends when adjacent paths in the array are intersecting.

The join function accepts an array of `Path` objects
(either names in the `paths` array or direct references to `Path` objects).
This array can contain `null` values or hidden paths (created with `path.hide()`) to create gaps.

By default, the `join` macro will join the paths in a circular fashion, joining the end
of the last path in the array to the start of the first path, creating a full outline.
If this is not desired, insert a `null` element between paths where you want the gap
(or at the end of the `paths` parameter).

Note that a `null` value will create a basic gap in the output,
if you instead include a hidden path, this method will still create sharp corners as if the path were present,
but the actual path will be skipped in the output.

## Signature

```js
Path macro('join', {
  Array paths,
  number limit,
  string mode
})
```

## Example

<Example caption="An example of the join macro">

```js
;({ Point, points, Path, paths, macro, part }) => {
  paths.a = new Path().move(new Point(10, 10)).line(new Point(10, 20))

  paths.b = new Path().move(new Point(25, 30)).line(new Point(55, 30))

  paths.c = new Path().move(new Point(40, 20)).line(new Point(40, 50))

  paths.d = new Path().move(new Point(50, 60)).line(new Point(60, 60))

  paths.e = new Path()
    .move(new Point(70, 40))
    .curve(new Point(55, 15), new Point(55, 15), new Point(30, 0))

  paths.join = macro('join', {
    paths: ['a', 'b', 'c', null, 'd', 'e'],
  }).setClass('stroke-sm mark dotted')

  return part
}
```

## Configuration

| Property | Default    | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------: | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `paths` |            | `array`  | An array of pathnames, the names of Paths in the `paths` array to join (you can also reference `Path` objects directly, or insert `null` elements to create gaps) |
|   `mode` | `'corner'` | `string` | Mode for joining paths. Either `'corner'` or `'cut'`. `'cut'` will join the paths directly without extending them (like `path.join(...)`).                        |
|  `limit` | `null`     | `number` | Allows limiting the length of corners in `'corner'` mode. Prevents overly long joins on very sharp angles. Ignored if `null` or `false`.                          |
