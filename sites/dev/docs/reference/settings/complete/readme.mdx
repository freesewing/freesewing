title: complete
---

The `complete` setting controls the level of detail that is included on a
pattern.
Set `complete` to `false` when the pattern should include only
the base outlines needed to cut out the pattern pieces.
Seam allowance and all other details will be omitted from the pattern.

This has different use cases, such as generating patterns to be cut out with a
laser cutter.

## Signature

```js
const settings = {
  Boolean complete=true
}
```

The default `complete` setting is `true`.
Set this to `false` to draft a base outline of the pattern, rather than a fully detailed pattern.


## Example
```js
import { Aaron } from "@freesewing/aaron"

const pattern = new Aaron({
  complete: false
})
```

## Notes

The `complete` setting does not automatically cause pattern detail
to be omitted.
Instead, it is up to the pattern designer to have the design
check for the `complete` setting,
omit the appropriate details if set to `true`,
and include them if set to `false`.

Setting `complete` to `false` will also cause [`sa`](/reference/settings/sa)
to be set to `0` to remove the seam allowance.
