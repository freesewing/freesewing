title: options
---

The `options` setting allows you to specify values for the pattern-specific
options that have been implemented by the pattern designer.

## Signature

```js
const settings = {
  Object options={}
}
```

## Example

```js
import { Aaron } from "@freesewing/aaron"

const pattern = new Aaron({
  options: {
    chestEase: 0.065,
    necklineDrop: 0.17,
  }
})
```

## Notes

Unlike measurements, options come with defaults.

The available options are listed in the part configuration.
Refer to the [the options section in the part configuration][1] for
all details about using options in FreeSewing.
