title: paperless
---

The `paperless` setting indicates whether a pattern is to be printed onto paper.
Set `paperless` to `true` when the pattern will not be printed as a standard paper pattern.
Instead, the paperless pattern will include a grid overlay, dimensions, and
other information.

The grid overlay, dimensions, and other information is intended to help users
who might transfer the pattern to paper by hand or using a projector.

## Signature

```js
const settings = {
  Boolean paperless=false
}
```

Set this to `true` to draft a paperless pattern. The default is `false`.

## Example

```js
import { Aaron } from "@freesewing/aaron"

const pattern = new Aaron({
  paperless: true
})
```

## Notes

The `paperless` setting does not automatically cause dimensions
and other information to be generated on a pattern.
Instead, it is up to the pattern designer to have the design
check for the `paperless` setting,
include the appropriate dimensions and information if set to `true`,
and omit them if set to `false`.

The `paperless` setting does automatically cause the grid to be included.

Setting `paperless` to `true` will also cause the [margin](/reference/settings/margin) to not go below 10 mm.
