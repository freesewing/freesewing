title: sa
---

The `sa` setting controls the seam allowance. Either provide value in
millimeter or set it to `false` or `0` to disable seam allowance altogether.

Setting a seam allowance causes the pattern to be generated with
additional lines so pattern pieces can be cut out with the correct
seam allowance included.

## Signature

```js
const settings = {
  Number|Boolean sa=false
}
```

By default, the `sa` setting is `false` and seam allowance is not included.

## Example

```js
import { Aaron } from "@freesewing/aaron"

const pattern = new Aaron({
  sa: 10
})
```

## Notes

The `sa` setting does not automatically cause seam allowances to
be displayed on a pattern.
Instead, it is up to the pattern designer to have the design check
for the `sa` setting and include the appropriate seam allowance lines
on the pattern when `sa` is set to a non-zero numeric value.

The `sa` setting is automatically set to `0` to disable seam allowance if
[settings.complete](/reference/settings/complete) is `false`.
