title: eyelet
---

The `eyelet` snippet is used to mark an eyelet, which is a small reinforced opening or hole.

It is provided by [plugin-annotations](/reference/plugins/annotations/), which is
part of [core-plugins](/reference/plugins/core) (so it is available by default).

## Example

<Example caption="An example of the eyelet snippet">
```js
({ Point, Path, paths, Snippet, snippets, part }) => {

  snippets.demo = new Snippet('eyelet', new Point(0,0))

  // Prevent clipping
  paths.diag = new Path()
    .move(new Point(-50,-4))
    .move(new Point(50,4))

  return part
}
```
</Example>
