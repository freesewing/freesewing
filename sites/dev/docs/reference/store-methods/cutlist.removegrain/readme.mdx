title: cutlist.removeGrain()
---

The `cutlist.removeGrain()` store method will remove stored grainline
information.

This method is called internally by [the `rmGrainline` macro](/reference/macros/rmgrainline).
to remove stored information for cutting layout tools.
In other words, you typically have no reason to call this method manually.

## Signature

```js
undefined store.cutlist.removeGrain()
