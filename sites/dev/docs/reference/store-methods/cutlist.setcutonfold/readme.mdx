title: cutlist.setCutOnFold()
---
The `cutlist.setCutOnFold()` store method will take two points
to determine the cut on fold line.

This method is called internally by [the `cutonfold` macro](/reference/macros/cutonfold) to store information for cutting layout tools.
In other words, you typically have no reason to call this method manually.

## Signature

```js
undefined store.cutlist.setCutOnFold(Point p1, Point p2)
```
