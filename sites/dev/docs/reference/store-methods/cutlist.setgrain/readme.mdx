title: cutlist.setGrain()
---

The `store.cutlist.setGrain()` method will take an angle to determine the grainline.

This method is called internally by [the `grainline` macro](/reference/macros/grainline).
to store information for cutting layout tools.
In other words, you typically have no reason to call this method manually.

## Signature

```js
undefined store.cutlist.setGrain(Number grainAngle)
```
