title: unflag.preset()
---

This removes a specific piece of information flagged through the [`flag.preset()`](/reference/store-methods/flag.preset) method.

## Signature

```js
undefined Store.unflag.preset(string id)
```

Since these methods are not part of FreeSewing's core API, what you pass to this method does depend on your own implementation.

See [flag.preset()](/reference/store-methods/flag.preset) for a list of available presets.

For a more detailed example of how we use this, see [flag.info()](/reference/store-methods/flag.info).
