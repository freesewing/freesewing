FreeSewing provides a development environment to help you design and develop patterns.

There are two ways to run this development environment:

- [**Monorepo development**](#monorepo-development): Use this if you intend to contribute your work to FreeSewing
- [**Stand-alone development**](#stand-alone-development): Use this if you want to do your own thing, and not contribute to FreeSewing

## Monorepo development

Run `yarn lab` to start the development environment:

```bash
yarn lab
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8000

### Adding a new design
This is all you need to work on existing designs. If you'd like to add a new design, run:

```bash
yarn new design
```

Just make sure to re-start the lab afterwards with `yarn lab`
:::

## Stand-alone development

To start the development environment, enter the folder that was created
and run `yarn dev` (or `npm run dev` if you're using npm as a package manager).

Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000

:::tip
The development environment will watch for any changes you make to
the pattern's source code or configuration.
When you do, it will update automatically in your browser.

##### Yay, you're done!

All you have to do now is design your pattern.
Thankfully, we have a tutorial for that too:
