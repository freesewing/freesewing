Now we will use `nvm` to install Node.js. Run the following command:

```bash
nvm install lts/hydrogen
```

This will install the so-called LTS version of Node.js 18 on your system.

LTS versions -- short for Long Term Support -- are good Node.js versions
to use because they are stable and supported for a long time.
