title: A part's draft method
sidebar_position: 50

Time to turn our attention to the draft method of our part.
Inside our `src/bib.mjs` file, this is what it currently looks like:

```design/src/bib.mjs
function draftBib({ part }) {
  return part
}
```

This is an empty skeleton for a draft method. A draft method should always
return the part object, and that's effectively the only thing it currently
does.

## Destructuring the function parameter

If you're not familiar with the `({ part })` syntax you see above, this is a
technique called _parameter destructuring_ or more generally, [object
destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).

The draft method receives only 1 parameter: An object that holds everything we
need to draft our method. Destructuring is a way to _pull things out of the
object into their own variable_. It saves us a bunch of typing as these two are
equivalent:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='without' label="Without descructuring">

```design/src/bib.mjs
function draftBib(props) {

  return props.part

}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='with' label="With descructuring">

```design/src/bib.mjs
function draftBib({ part }) {

  return part
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

As we'll make our way through this tutorial, we'll need more and more stuff, so
we'll be pulling it out of the object passed to the draft method via
_destructuring_.

:::note

If you're new to JavaScript, and don't intuitively _get this_, stick with it. It will become second nature soon enough.

## Destructuring what we need to start drawing our bib

Change the function to look like this:

```design/src/bib.mjs
function draftBib({
// highlight-start
  Path,
  Point,
  paths,
  points,
// highlight-end
  part,
}) {

  return part
}
```

That's a bunch of new lines, but each of one gives us something we'll use in this
tutorial.

For a complete list of what you can access via destructuring like this, refer
to [the draft method reference documentation](/reference/api/part/draft).
Here's a brief summary of the things we've added above:

- `Path`: The Path constructor, allows us to create new Paths
- `Point`: The Point constructor, allows us to create new Points
- `points`: A container object to hold the part's points
- `paths`: A container object to hold the part's paths

:::tip
Remember: Constructors start with a **C**apital letter
:::

Long story short: These will make it possible for us to draw points and paths easily.

So let's go ahead and do that.
