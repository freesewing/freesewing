    <h2>What to expect at lab.freesewing.org</h2>
    <p>The FreeSewing lab is an online environment to road-test our various patterns/designs.</p>
    <p>
      This website runs the bleeding edge of our code base. Some patterns here may be unreleased or
      at various states of being worked on. As such, this website is intended for FreeSewing
      contributors or people interested in what happens under the hood.
