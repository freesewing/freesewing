      <p className="text-base">
        I recently added a backend endpoint to auto-generate pretty (I hope) Open Graph images. They
        are those little preview images you see when you paste a link in Discord (for example).
      </p>
      <p className="text-base">
        This idea is that it will auto-generate an image, but I am certain there are some edge cases
        where that will not work. There are hundreds of pages on this website and checking them all
        one by one is not something I see myself doing. But since you are here on this page, perhaps
        you could see if the image above looks ok.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base">Thank you, I really appreciate your help with this.</p>
