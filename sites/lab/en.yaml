what: What is the FreeSewing lab?
what1: The FreeSewing lab started out as an online hosted version of our stand-alone development environment. It offers advanced features for pattern designers and contributors to develop and test patterns. Features that were not available on FreeSewing.org.
what2: Since version 3 of FreeSewing, all these advanced features are available to users on FreeSewing.org.  which means that there is nothing here that you cannot also find on FreeSewing.org.
what3: The lab nowadays is a stripped-down version of FreeSewing.org. It does not include documentation, blog or showcase posts, and so on.  We keep it arund because it is faster to spin up/deploy than the entire website, while still providing all the core features.
