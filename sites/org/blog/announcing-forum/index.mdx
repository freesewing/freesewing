We have launched the official FreeSewing forum at
[forum.freesewing.eu](https://forum.freesewing.eu/).

<!-- truncate -->

The idea that a _good old forum_ would arguably be a better for for the
FreeSewing community than the social network of the day is not new, it's
something that has always held true.

However, we were always reluctant to take on the additional burden of
operating/maintaining/managing/moderating such a forum, because, well there's
only 24 hours in a day.

However, given the efforts we are making to keep our user's data out of the
reach of the US administration, it felt like the time was right to do it.

And so we did. The official FreeSewing forum lives at
[forum.freesewing.eu](https://forum.freesewing.eu/) and you can (and should)
use your FreeSewing account for authentication.

It's a bit empty still, so don't be shy and come say hello.
