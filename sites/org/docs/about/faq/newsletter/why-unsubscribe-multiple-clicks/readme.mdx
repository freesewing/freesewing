title: Why do I have to click again to confirm I want to unsubscribe from the newsletter?
---

While we could make it so that clicking the link in your
email would immediately unsubscribe you, it would be in violation of internet standards.
Specifically, the __HTTP__ protocol's __GET method__ definition which states that:


:::note

<h5>GET requests should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.</h5>

[wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#HTTP/1.1_request_messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#HTTP/1.1_request_messages)

:::

A _GET request_ is what happens when you follow a link. Merely following a link
should not make any changes (like unsubscribing you from a newsletter).

For example, when you receive an email, your email client
may _preload_ the links in it in the background. So that they are quicker to
load should you click on them.

Obviously, this preloading should not unsubscribe you. Which is why
you need to click a button to confirm. Because that will trigger a __POST request__
and those can make changes.

:::tip


##### This does not apply to users unsubscribing through their account

None of this applies to users who unsubscribe from our newsletter by disabling the
option in their account. In this case, you are already clicking a button, rather
than a link in your email.

If you are curious, we use an idempotent __PUT request__ under the hood.
