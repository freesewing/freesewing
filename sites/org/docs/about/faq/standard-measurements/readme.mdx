title: Where did the "standard" measurements go?
---

In past versions of FreeSewing, we published a sizing table so that users could try out the platform without entering their measurements. Because there are no real standards for sizes, ours were -- like all sizing charts -- made up.

We found that publishing these created unreasonable expectations. Users were disappointed when their patterns generated with "standard" sizes didn't fit as they expected. We removed the made up measurements in favor of [curated measurements sets](https://freesewing.org/curated-sets).

We also removed the ability to compare your measurements to "standard" ones to try to identify potential mismeasurements. In the future, we may implement different ways to check, but will only display these to users who are [comfortable with their measurement sets being compared](https://freesewing.org/account/compare).
