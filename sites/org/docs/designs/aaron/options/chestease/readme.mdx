![The chest ease option on Aaron](./chestease.svg)

How much room do you want at the chest?

Whatever value you provide here will simply be added to your chest circumference measurement when drafting the garment.

> Given that an undershirt has no arms, a little chest ease goes a long way. Add too much, and you'll end up with gaping armholes.

> ##### This option also allows negative values
>
> You should only use negative ease if you are using a stretch material that you want to fit tightly.
> Overall stretch should be configured with the **stretch** option.
