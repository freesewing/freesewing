## Designer Notes {#notes}

Albert was something that I didn't plan on making. My daughter, who's a visual artist, asked if I could make her an
apron. Of course, I could not deny her such a request. And since I didn't have a pattern, I needed to make one.
And that meant that I could just as well make one for FreeSewing while I was at it.

The design is simple, since an apron generally is. And yet, where else than at FreeSewing can you get a
bespoke apron?

This is a very good project for a beginning sewist.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Albert, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1.25 meters (1.4 yards) (depending on the length of your apron) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/designs/albert#fabric))

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

An apron works best with a fabric that is sturdy, tightly woven, and easy to clean.
In addition, make sure to go for a natural fibre and in any case something that is
heat-resistant.

Heavy cotton, chino, canvas or denim are all excellent choices.

When in doubt, go for raw denim (pure cotton, if it stretches it's no good).

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut **1 front** on the fold
- Cut **1 pocket** on the fold
