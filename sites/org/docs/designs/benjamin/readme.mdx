## Designer Notes {#notes}

Benjamin is the first design I have ever made for FreeSewing. I had just discovered Joost's site, then
still called MakeMyPattern. The site only had designs made by Joost, and he invited others to help
him. This seemed like something I could undertake. Since I had no experience with making patterns,
my first attempt should be a simple one. The site already had a pattern for a tie, yet I prefer bow ties.
So that would be something I could contribute.

In the concept of MakeMyPattern was the possibility of patterns not only adapting to the measurements of
the sewist, but also that patterns could change depending on the options one would like. So I tried
to incorporate some options that I thought bow ties should have.

The bow tie can be made to be tied traditionally, and it also allows for a specific band to be added
that will make the bow tie adjustable. These can be found in speciality stores, and are available online.

Because of the precision needed, and the curved seams, this may not be the easiest pattern to start
with. But is is a nice one to help you use those scraps from other projects.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Benjamin, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/designs/benjamin#fabric)). Left over
  pieces of a recent project could work too.
- About the same amount of interfacing
- Optionally: Bow tie adjustment ribbon and hardware

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

The bow ties you find in the store are typically make out of silk or some imitation silk poly.
So it will come as no surprise that those are good options. Any type of fabric that you like
the pattern or looks of can become a candidate for a bow tie. The only real limitation is
that the bow tie will have to be turned inside out through a tube that is only 2cm across.
With some thicker fabrics, this will be a difficult proposition.

Bow ties are more whimsical than normal ties, so having a fun pattern or loud colour is not
as much of a problem as it would be with a regular tie.

Silk and silk imitation is slippery and tricky to work with. This can be compensated for with
a fusible interfacing.

### Interfacing

Depending on the fabric you chose for your bow tie, you will probably need interfacing. Interfacing
comes in two main types: fusible and sew-in.

The fusible variety has some adhesive attached to one side that is activated with the heat
of your iron. This attaches the interfacing to the fabric and the two can then be used as one.
Fusible interfacing can be a great option if your fabric allows the heat required, and you
use a quality interfacing. Some lesser quality interfacings can have the adhesive detach,
and this shows as bubbles on the fabric surface later on in the life of your bow tie. Good
quality interfacings and correctly following the guidelines for adhering the interfacing
will not present these problems.

Sew-in interfacing is sew into place before the fabric pieces are used. You attach the
interfacing to the fabric by sewing the two together inside the seam allowance. If you use
a seam allowance of 6mm, you will sew the interfacing at 3mm.
Anything may work as a sew-in interfacing, including an extra layer of the same fabric.

The key part of the interfacing is to give your bow tie the structure you like. You can have
a bow tie that stands proud and crisp. Or one that droops a bit at the tips. This is all about
your preference.

It is good to experiment with the interfacing on a scrap piece of your fabric, specially with
the fusible kind. You want to make sure you get the structure you like before committing it
to your pattern pieces.

Although the pattern calls for applying interfacing to all parts, if you have thick or stiff
fabric, you may be able to only do one side, or no sides at all.
