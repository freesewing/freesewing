To make Lily, you will need the following:

  Options](#fabric))

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Lily is designed for stretch fabrics. 2-way stretch can be used as long as the
stretch is perpendicular to the grainline. 4-way stretch can also be used. It
is important to remember that **not** all stretch fabrics have the same amount
of stretch. You may have to adjust the ease and fabric stretch options to match
the stretch of you fabric.

The type of fabric you want depends on use desired. If you are making an
Athletic Lily you may wish to use fabrics such as **Spandex**. If you are
making a Lily for warmth you may wish to use **Winter knit** fabric just bear
in mind these may have less stretch than the default settings for Lily.
