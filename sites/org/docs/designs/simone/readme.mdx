## Designer Notes {#notes}

Simone is essentially [Simon](https://freesewing.org/designs/simon) with a full-bust adjustment.

The
initial intent was to allow people with breasts to have a better fitted shirt
design, but anyone can choose Simone for a more female-presenting look due to
the bust dart.

Simone has all of the options Simon has, it only adds the FBA to it.
