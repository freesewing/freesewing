## Designer Notes {#notes}

I like waistcoats. I think they are not only pretty to look at, they are also
warm, cut down on the amount of shirt ironing you have to do, and have these
cute little pockets you can put tiny things in.

So, I designed Wahid so I could make waistcoats for myself.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Wahid, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](#fabric))
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of lining fabric
- Fusible interfacing
- Buttons

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

All suiting fabrics are a great choice for your waistcoats. Any fabric shop
that's worth your business should have a suiting section. You can just walk in,
ask where you can find the fabric for suits, and pick out something you like.

These fabrics are typically wool, but you can also be a bit more creative and
go for something else.

:::tip
You do need a bit of weight though. Denim is fine, some light cotton is not.
