A _measurements set_ holds a set of measurements along with meta data.

In addition to the measurements -- which is the most important data in a set --
a FreeSewing measurements set also has the following fields:

- [Name](#name)
- [Notes](#notes)
- [Image](#img)
- [Units](#units)
- [Public](#public)

## Name

Every measurements set has a **name** attribute that is mandatory.\
In other words, you must give each of your measurements sets a name, but that
name can be anything you want.

Typically, people give names that describe the set, like:

- Myself, January 2024
- Tony with binder
- Jenny post augmentation

But you do you.

## Notes

Every measurements set has a **notes** attribute that is optional.\
The notes field allows you to add your notes to a measurements set.
This field supports markdown, so you can use rich formatting, or even embed images.

:::note
If you make your measurements set public, your notes will also be public.

### Image

Every measurements set has a **image** attribute that is optional.

A picture says more than a 1000 words, so if you have multiple measurements
sets, this can help you tell them apart.

So if you want, you can add an image to your measurements set. It's up to you.

:::note
If you make your measurements set public, your image will also be public.

## Units

Every measurements set has a **units** attribute that controls what units will
be used to display measurements in the set.

While each FreeSewing user has a **units** setting in their account that
controls their overall preference between imperial or metric units, it is common
to also have measurements sets for different people, and those different people
might have other preferences.

That is why we allow you to set the units on each measurements set.

## Public

Every measurements set has a **public** attribute that controls whether or not
the measurements set is public.

By default, measurements sets are private and you are the only one who can use
them.

But, you can choose to make your measurements set public which allows other
users to utilize the measurements in this set to generate or test their own
patterns.

:::note
If you make your measurements set public, this applies to all data in the
measurements set. In other words, not only the measurements, but also the
name, notes, and picture will be visible to other users.
