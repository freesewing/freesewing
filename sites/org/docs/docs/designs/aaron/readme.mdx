## What You Need {#needs}

To make Aaron, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.75 meters (0.8 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric
  options](#fabric))

:::note

#### A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life
easier.

If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it.
Because these side seams and shoulder seams won't get stretched out, you can
just sew them with a regular straight stitch.
:::

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

An A-shirt is essentially underwear. And in that capacity, you want something
that is comfortable, feels nice on your skin and breaths.

Cotton with a hint of something stretchy, maybe rayon, or a fine knit. I
suggest you go to the fabric store and feel around a bit.

:::note
While stretch is not required, it does make sense for underwear. That being
said, you can make this in a non-stretch, just make sure pick loose or casual
fit.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut **1 back** on the fold
- Cut **1 front** on the fold
- Cut **3 strips** for neck opening and armhole binding

:::warning

#### Caveats

- There is no seam allowance on the armholes
- There is no seam allowance on the neck opening
- There is extra hem allowance at the hem
