## What You Need {#needs}

To make Albert, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1.25 meters (1.4 yards) (depending on the length of your apron) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/designs/albert#fabric))

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

An apron works best with a fabric that is sturdy, tightly woven, and easy to clean.
In addition, make sure to go for a natural fibre and in any case something that is
heat-resistant.

Heavy cotton, chino, canvas or denim are all excellent choices.

When in doubt, go for raw denim (pure cotton, if it stretches it's no good).

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut **1 front** on the fold
- Cut **1 pocket** on the fold
- Cut **2 straps**
