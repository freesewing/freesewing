## What You Need {#needs}

To make Bee, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 - 1 metre (0.6 - 1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Bee Fabric options](/docs/designs/bee#fabric))
- (Optional) About 0.5 - 1 metre (0.6 - 1.1 yards) of lining fabric ([see Bee Fabric options](/docs/designs/bee#fabric))
- (Optional) Ribbons/Tapes/Cords for neck ties and bands, with the same length and width as neck tie and/or band.

:::note
The lining fabric is only needed if you want to make this pattern reversible. If you don't, you only need the main fabric.
You can use a serger/overlocker to construct this pattern but it is not mandatory.
Ribbons/Tapes/Cords can be used instead of making custom ties. Just make sure to get more than you need and that you cut down to size after construction.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main and Lining Fabric

The main and lining fabric are the same type of material. Bee is made with swimwear fabrics such as lycras.

:::note
You only need lining fabric if you intend to make the pattern reversible or if you want the band for the cross back tie variant to be a contrasting fabric. Otherwise you can cut all the required pieces from your main fabric.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

There are three variations of this pattern. **One Colour**, which is where the bikini top is made out of one colour. **Two Colours**, where the bikini top is made reversible by using two colours, and **Cross Back Tie Variant**, where the neck ties tie in the back replacing the band tie.

### One Colour (Non-Reversible)

**Main fabric**

- Cut **4 cup** parts.
- Cut **2 neck tie** parts.
- Cut **1 band tie** part.

### Two Colours (Reversible)

**Main fabric**

- Cut **2 cup** parts from main.
- Cut **2 neck tie** parts.
- Cut **1 band tie** part.

**Lining fabric**

- Cut **2 cup** parts.
- Cut **2 neck tie** parts.
- Cut **1 band tie** part.

### Cross Back Tie Variant.

**Main fabric**

- Cut **4 cup** parts or Cut **2 cups** from main and lining if making reversible ties.
- Cut **2 neck tie** parts or Cut **2 neck ties** from main and lining if making reversible ties.
- Cut **1 band** part if making cross back tie variant instead of band tie variant.

:::note
This pattern is easily made reversible by buying a similar fabric to the main fabric and using it as contrast. To save confusion on instructions it will be referred to as the lining fabric.
