## What You Need {#needs}

To make Bee, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 - 1 metre (0.6 - 1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Bee Fabric options](/docs/designs/bee#fabric))
- (Optional) About 0.5 - 1 metre (0.6 - 1.1 yards) of lining fabric ([see Bee Fabric options](/docs/designs/bee#fabric))
- (Optional) Ribbons/Tapes/Cords for neck ties and bands, with the same length and width as neck tie and/or band.

:::note
The lining fabric is only needed if you want to make this pattern reversible. If you don't, you only need the main fabric.
You can use a serger/overlocker to construct this pattern but it is not mandatory.
Ribbons/Tapes/Cords can be used instead of making custom ties. Just make sure to get more than you need and that you cut down to size after construction.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main and Lining Fabric

The main and lining fabric are the same type of material. Bee is made with swimwear fabrics such as lycras.

:::note
You only need lining fabric if you intend to make the pattern reversible or if you want the band for the cross back tie variant to be a contrasting fabric. Otherwise you can cut all the required pieces from your main fabric.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

**Main fabric**

- Cut **4 cup** parts.
- Cut **2 neck tie** parts.
- Cut **1 band tie** part on fold.

:::note
This pattern is easily made reversible by buying a similar fabric to the main fabric and using it as contrast.

**Main fabric**

- Cut **2 cup** parts.
- Cut **2 neck tie** part.
- Cut **1 band tie** part on fold.

**Constrast Fabric**

- Cut **2 cup** parts.
- Cut **2 neck tie** part.
- Cut **1 band tie** part on fold.

However if you are using the Cross Back Tie variation the band is designed to **only** be cut from the main fabric.

When following the instructions use your contrasting pieces as the lining peices.
