title: 'Front armhole extra cutout'
---

How much the armhole is cut out deeper at the front, than the back.

Because a shoulder is more rounded at the front of the body than the back,
the front of the armhole cuts deeper into the chest than the back cuts into
the back part.

This options controls by how much.
