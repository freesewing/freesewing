:::tip Bent is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based. They are sometimes
also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are
different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other
patterns.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Bent, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.5 - 2 metres (1.7 - 2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Bent Fabric options](/docs/designs/bent#fabric))

This list is for a default Bent Block. If you have/are making changes to the block you may need to get additional items such as closures, binding etc.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

If you are making a default Bent to see how it fits we recommend a fabric such as **Calico (Muslin)** or a cheaper fabric that matches the drape and stretch of the fabric you intend to make a finalised version of Bella with.

You can use scraps of fabrics from your stash so don't worry about buying fabric specifically for Bent.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

**Main fabric**

- Cut **1 Front** part on the fold.
- Cut **1 Back** part on the fold.
- Cut **2 Top sleeve** parts.
- Cut **2 Under sleeve** parts.

These cutting instructions are just for the default Bent block. Adjust your cutting accordingly if you have/are making changes to the block.

:::warning
As Bent is a block it does not have any closures. If you are making a test Bent you will want to Cut 2 Front parts with seam allowances so you can pin yourself into it.
