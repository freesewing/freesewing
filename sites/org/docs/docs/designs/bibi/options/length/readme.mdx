title: 'Length'
---

Which measurement to use for the bottom hem.
If the length bonus is zero, the bottom of the garment will be at exactly the selected measurement.

Note that the options _underbust_, _knee_ and _floor_ require the corresponding optional vertical measurements.
If they are missing, a very rough estimate is used instead.

Use a negative length bonus when selecting _floor_ to prevent the garment from actually dragging on the floor.
