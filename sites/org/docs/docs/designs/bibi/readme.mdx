## What You Need {#needs}

To make Bibi, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1 - 3 metres (1.1 - 3.3 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- A short crop top without sleeves needs probably less than a meter, a long
  dress with sleeves needs much more fabric.

:::tip A serger/overlock is nice, but optional
As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life
easier. If you do not have one of those, don’t despair. You don’t really need
it. All serged seams on Bibi can also be sewn with a short, narrow zigzag
stitch (~2 mm wide) on a standard sewing machine.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Bibi is by default designed as a close-fitting top and is best suited to knit
fabrics with some stretch, such as jersey.

If your main fabric is elastic enough, can use strips of it to finish the
waistband, armholes/cuffs and neck opening. Alternatively, you can also use
rib fabric or store-bought strips of knit binding.

If you are making a default Bibi to see how it fits we recommend to start with
a cheap fabric, such as old bedsheets, that matches the drape and stretch of
the fabric you intend to make a finalised with.

:::tip
If you're new to sewing, interlock jersey is nice to work with, as it doesn't
roll up. Prefer jersey with a few percent spandex for better recovery.

Fabric weights can also help you make your choice. A weight of 130-200 grams
per square meter (or 4-6 ounces per square yard) is likely to be about right
for a basic shirt.
:::

:::note
Woven fabrics with good drape and thicker fabrics such as sweat could also
work. Increase all ease settings to at least around 15% and ensure the neck
hole is large enough to fit a head through. Alternatively, you can also add a
zipper or buttons to the front or back to make it easier to put on.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- **Main fabric**
  - Cut 1 _Front_ on the fold
  - Cut 1 _Back_ on the fold
  - Cut 2 _Sleeve(s)_ mirrored (if enabled)
- **Ribbing**
  - Cut 1 _Neck Binding_
  - Cut 2 _Armhole Binding(s)_ or _Cuff(s)_ (depending on selected options)
  - Cut 1 _Waistband_ (if enabled)

:::warning Caveats

- There is extra hem allowance at the bottom hem if there is no _Waistband_
  part.
- There is extra hem allowance at the sleeve part if there is no _Cuff_ part.
- There is no seam allowance on the neck opening.
- There is no seam allowance on the armhole if the sleeve is disabled.
- There is no seam allowance on the long sides of the _Armhole Binding_ and
  _Neck Binding_ parts.

:::tip
You can cut the front or back parts on the fold, or you can cut the halves
separately and sew them together. This is especially useful if you only have
smaller pieces of fabric or if you want to add buttons or zippers to your
design. In this case, make sure to add sufficient seam allowance on the center
fold.
