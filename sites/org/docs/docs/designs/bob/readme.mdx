## Designer Notes {#notes}

The only reason I designed this pattern is because I wanted something very
simple to use in our [pattern design
tutorial](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/pattern-design).

In fact, I considered this design too simple to include on FreeSewing.org and
for many years it was not available.
But then users started asking _why_ it was not available, and I didn't really
have a good answer for that.

So here it is. A fully parametric bib named Bob.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Bob, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- A little bit of suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/designs/bob#fabric))
- Enough bias tape to go around the entire bib
- A snap or other type of fastener

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

An bib should be soft, absorbent, and be able to handle plenty of washing cycles.
In addition, natural fibres are much preferred, especially for babies.

So use cotton, flannel, or jersey knit for the bib front of the bib, and back it with
something like terrycloth (aka towel fabric) or a similar bamboo-based fabric.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut **1 bib**

:::warning
There is no seam allowance on the bib, it will be finished with bias tape
