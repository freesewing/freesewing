## What You Need {#needs}

To make Bob, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- A little bit of suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/designs/bob#fabric))
- Enough bias tape to go around the entire bib
- A snap or other type of fastener

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

An bib should be soft, absorbent, and be able to handle plenty of washing cycles.
In addition, natural fibres are much preferred, especially for babies.

So use cotton, flannel, or jersey knit for the bib front of the bib, and back it with
something like terrycloth (aka towel fabric) or a similar bamboo-based fabric.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut **1 bib**

:::warning
There is no seam allowance on the bib, it will be finished with bias tape
