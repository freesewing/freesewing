:::tip Breanna is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based. They are sometimes
also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are
different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other
patterns.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Breanna, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.25 - 1.5 metres (1.4 - 1.7 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Breanna
  Fabric options](#fabric))

This list is for a default Breanna Block. If you have/are making changes to the
block you may need to get additional items such as closures, binding etc.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

If you are making a default Breanna to see how it fits we recommend a fabric
such as **Calico (Muslin)** or a cheaper fabric that matches the drape and
stretch of the fabric you intend to make a finalised version of Breanna with.

You can use scraps of fabrics from your stash so don't worry about buying
fabric specifically for Breanna.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

**Main fabric**

- Cut **1 Front** part on the fold.
- Cut **2 Back** parts.
- Cut **2 Sleeve** parts, _good sides together_.

These cutting instructions are just for the default Breanna block. Adjust your cutting accordingly if you have/are making changes to the block.

:::tip
If you do not have someone to help pin you into Breanna then you may find it
easier to Cut 2 Front parts with seam allowance and sew the backs up when
constructing so you can pin in the front.
