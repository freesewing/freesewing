## Designer Notes {#notes}

I originally designed Bruce many years ago, and it's gone through a couple of
iterations since. Most notably, Bruce can now be adapted to not have any bulge,
making it a fully gender-neutral design and a popular choice for people who
want a express a more masculine look without sacrificing fit.

I have not worn any other underwear than Bruce for at least a decade.
Suffice to say Bruce comes highly recommended.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Bruce, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- Enough wide (3cm (1.2 inch) or wider) elastic to fit around your waist
- A serger, although you can survive without one

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

You need a stretchy fabric for this pattern. Preferable something that is
comfortable and soft to the touch, while allowing the skin to breathe.

I personally think that nothing can beat rayon for this pattern, although you
can do with some other knit too, like jersey.

When in doubt, go for rayon.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

Bruce consists of a back, and two sides, insets and fronts.

- **Main fabric**
  - Cut **1 back** on the fold
  - Cut **2 fronts**
  - Cut **2 insets**
  - Cut **2 sides**

:::warning Caveats

- **back**: Extra hem allowance at the leg
- **front**: Cut this **twice**
