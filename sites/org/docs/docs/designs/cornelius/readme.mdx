## What You Need {#needs}

To make Cornelius, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 2 metres (2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- About 0.5 metres (0.6 yards) of lining fabric ([see Fabric options](#fabric))
- Interfacing for the waistband ([see Fabric options](#fabric))
- A zip or 3 buttons for the fly
- 3 or 7 Buttons for waistband and leg bands

:::tip
The number of buttons you need are dependent on the cuff style you are using.
**Keystone** requires 7 in total whereas **Traditional** and **Elegant**
require 3 in total. You may also want to use smaller buttons for the leg bands
compared to the waistband but this is up to you.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

Any **bottom (trouser) weight material** will work fine for this pattern.
Generally you want to avoid anything that is over 7oz (230gsm) as this will
more likely be too stiff and uncomfortable. You want something that provides a
bit of warmth whilst still being able to drape such as **Corduroy** or **Medium
Weight Suiting** fabrics. If you are looking for something more historically
correct, then **Medium weight wool suiting** is the way to go. **Linen** is
also an option, especially if you would like something that isn't too warm.

:::warning
Remember that this garment is intended for cycling so needs to be able to move
with your legs when pedalling!
:::

### Lining (Pocket) Fabric

Basic **Cotton** will do the trick for the pocket bags. If you got left over
cotton from another project you can easily use it up for these pockets.
Remember that these are intended for cycling so you don't want anything too
fancy.

:::tip
If you have anything you typically use for pockets in trousers that will work.
too.
:::

### Interfacing

This pattern requires the waistband to be interfaced. We recommend using a
**Hair Cloth** for the interfacing, you can either use fusible or non-fusible
which ever you prefer. If you do not have access to hair cloth you can use any
medium to firm interfacing you deem appropriate for waistbands.

:::tip
If your main fabric is quite light, you may need to interface your leg bands
and zipper guard with a light weight interfacing.
