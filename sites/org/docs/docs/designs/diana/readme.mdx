## What You Need {#needs}

To make Diana, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1.5 meters (1.7 yards) (or half of that if it's wide enough to fit the
  sleeves next to the body) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))

:::tip A serger/overlock is nice, but optional
As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life
easier.

If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it.
Because these side seams and shoulder seams won't get stretched out, you can
just sew them with a regular straight stitch.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

This top works best in one of these two scenarios:

- Use a stretch fabric, and choose minimal ease
- Or use a non-stretch fabric with good _drape_, in which case you'll want to
  add more ease. Flowy fabrics can be cut on the bias for a body-hugging effect

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut **1 back** on the fold
- Cut **1 front** on the fold
- Cut **2 sleeves** with _good sides together_
