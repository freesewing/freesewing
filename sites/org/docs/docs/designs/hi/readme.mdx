## What You Need {#needs}

To make Hi, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric (Upper body) (see [Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of a suitable fabric (Belly) ([see [Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- Small piece for the mouth
- Small piece of fabric for eyes
- Suitable, unraveling, fabric for the teeth
- Stuffing
- Topstiching thread (thick thread) for gills

:::note
This list is based on a default Hi and you may need less or more fabric
dependant on the [size you are making Hi](/docs/designs/hi/options/size/).

For instance a 500% Hi will need 5 meters (1 meter x 500% = 5 meters) and a 50%
Hi will need 0.5 meters (1 meter x 50% = 0.5 meters).

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main and Contrast Body Fabrics (Upper body, belly and mouth)

This plush toy is intended to have three different coloured fabrics, one for
the upper body, one for the belly, and a smaller piece for the mouth. If you
don't wish to purchase additional fabric just for the mouth, it's a small
enough piece that you can likely use a scrap from the upper body or belly
fabric.

Hi is designed for faux fur fabric, which most plush toys are made from, but
you could also use polar fleece, felt, denim, corduroy, or anything moderately
heavy. Lightweight or drapey fabrics may not hold Hi's shape well when stuffed.
Fabrics with a two-way stretch will work better than wovens, the stretch should
be perpendicular to the grainline.

### Teeth Fabric

The teeth edges are left raw, so should be made from a fabric that does not
unravel such as felt.

### Stuffing

Since this is a plush toy, it will need to be stuffed with material. Most of
the time you'll want to use polyester fiberfill (polyfill), but if you have a
lot of fabric scraps, you can use shredded scrap fabric. However this may be
heavier and less soft than fiberfill. It's also worth thinking about whether
your Hi may be at risk of getting dirty, or want to go for a swim, as not all
stuffing options are washable.
