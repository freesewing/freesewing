If you've ever looked for leggings patterns (or tutorials) online, you've
probably noticed that many of them start with the rather presumptuous
instruction to "take a pair of leggings you own that fit well". Well, what if
you don't have any?

With some tiny modifications to the Titan design, Lily comes to the rescue.
Using waist, seat, knee and ankle circumferences, we'll draft a pattern to suit
your ~~booty~~ body.
