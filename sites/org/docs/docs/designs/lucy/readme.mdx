## What You Need {#needs}

To make Lucy, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric)
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of fabric if using a lining
- About 2 meters (2.2 yards) of bias binding or strips of fabric if binding the
  edges
- A length of tape that you can tie around your waist to make the ties with

:::tip Piecing is Period!

Pockets like these do not need to be made out of whole pieces of fabric, you
can piece together scraps into a large enough piece to cut your pocket pattern
out of. Neither do both sides need to be made out of the same fabric.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Because pockets were worn by people in every layer of society historically what
they were made out of varied intensely. Some were made out of sturdy and plain
fabrics, marked with the owners initials. Others were made out of lavish silks
or richly embroidered.

As such when it comes to fabric options the world is your oyster.

- Modern prints make fun modern pockets
- Use a plain cotton or linen for a more historical option
- Have a lot of scraps? Make a patchwork pocket!
- Pockets were often a first embroidery project, so go wild if you want to

The one thing to keep in mind is how stable your fabric is. If it is not very
stable or you think it won’t hold very much weight, you can add a lining.

Additionally, if you are handsewing your pocket it is worth picking a fabric
that isn’t too thick or heavy.

Your binding doesn’t have to be the same colour as the main fabric either. You
can use it to add a fun accent, or make your pocket fancier. Bias binding
curves easier around any curves, but you can just as easily use strips of
fabric as a more waste conscious option.

The ties can be made from self fabric, or you can use something like a twill
tape instead.

As always, whether you want to stick to historical practices or make something
modern is entirely up to you!
