## What You Need {#needs}

To make Lumina, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.5 metres (1.7 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- Elastic for the leg openings and waist.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

This pattern requires a stretch fabric. The stretch needs to be perpendicular
to the grainline. There is no stretch required along the grainline, but a 4-way
stretch fabric can definitely be used. Not all stretch fabrics have the same
amount of stretch. The default ease value of -5% works well for fabrics that
have 60% stretch. If your fabric has a different amount of stretch, you may
want to adjust this setting accordingly. Reduce the ease when your fabric has
more stretch. Getting the ease right is _very_ important for getting a good
fit.

:::tip
If the ease setting is larger than 0 (positive ease), any type of knit fabric
can be used. Keep in mind that even with the ease set at the maximum, you
probably will not be able to use a fabric with no stretch at all (a woven
fabric).
:::

These fabrics come in different weights. Pick one that works for how you intend
to use it. Thicker fabrics provide more support and warmth.

For yoga pants, take something that has a medium thickness. Supplex is a good
choice for this. It also works well for cycling. For other athletics use
fabrics that would be appropriate for that. Most fabrics that contain spandex
will work.

:::tip
Since this pattern has an outside panel, you can use contrasting fabrics to
make interesting effects.
