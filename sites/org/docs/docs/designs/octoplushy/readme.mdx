## What You Need {#needs}

To make Octoplushy, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric (Upper body) (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))
- About 0.75 meters (0.85 yards) of a suitable fabric (Belly) (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))
- Either 2 buttons or a small piece of suitable unraveling, fabric for the eyes
  of the Octoplushy version
- Small piece of black fabric for the pupils of the Squid and Octopus versions
- Small piece of white fabric for the eyes of the Squid and Octopus versions
- (Optional) Topstitch or Embroidery thread for the mouth of the Octoplushy
  version
- Stuffing

:::tip
This list is based on a default Octoplushy and you may need less or more fabric
dependant on the [size you are making
Octoplushy](/docs/designs/octoplushy/options#size).

The amount of fabric required is also dependant on the [type of Octoplushy you
are making](/docs/designs/octoplushy/options#type).

- The Octopus version requires about 50% more fabric than the Octoplushy
  version.
- The Squid version requires about 75% more fabric than the Octoplushy version.

The color of the pupils and eyes for the Squid and Octopus versions are up to
you, but for clarification and simplicity the pupils will be referred to as
black and the eyes will be referred to as white in the documentation.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main and Contrast Body Fabrics (Upper body and legs, belly and underside legs)

This plush toy is intended to have two different coloured fabrics, one for the
upper body and top side of the legs, one for the belly and underside of the
legs.

Octoplushy is designed for faux fur fabric, which most plush toys are made
from, but you could also use polar fleece, felt, denim, corduroy, or anything
moderately heavy. Lightweight or drapey fabrics may not hold Octoplushy's shape
well when stuffed. Fabrics with a two-way stretch will work better than wovens,
the stretch should be perpendicular to the grainline.

### Stuffing

Since this is a plush toy, it will need to be stuffed with material. Most of
the time you'll want to use polyester fiberfill (polyfill), but if you have a
lot of fabric scraps, you can use shredded scrap fabric. However this may be
heavier and less soft than fiberfill. It's also worth thinking about whether
your Octoplushy may be at risk of getting dirty, or want to go for a swim, as
not all stuffing options are washable.
