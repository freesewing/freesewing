title: 'Back on fold'
---

Controls if the back is made of of a single piece of fabric cut on the fold, or
as two mirrored pieces that are sewn together down the center.

- **Pro**: Saves a construction step, removes a seam, may be more comfortable.
- **Con**: Disadvantages: Doesn't work with zippers, harder to fit a larger
  pattern piece on the fabric (may cause more fabric waste).

:::tip Zippers
If using a back zipper, do _not_ enable this option.
