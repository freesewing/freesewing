title: Zipper position
---

Choose whether to place the zipper on the front, the back, or to not use a
zipper at all.

**Front Zipper**

- Easy for the wearer to reach the zipper.
- Allows for a tight neckline.
- Provides the least mobility of any option.

**Back Zipper**

- Allows greater mobility and stretch in the torso than a front zipper.
- Allows for a tight neckline.
- Can be hard to zip up and down by oneself.

**No Zipper**

- Allows maximum mobility and stretch in the torso.
- Easy to put on and take off the garment.
- Requires a very large neckline, since the neck must be able to stretch around
  the widest part of the hips.
