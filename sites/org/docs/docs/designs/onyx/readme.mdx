## What You Need {#needs}

To make Onyx, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- (Recommended) A serger/overlock machine. Light, strong, and stretchy seams
  are important for this garment.
- Between 1 - 5 meters (1.1 - 5.5 yards) of a suitable fabric, depending on
  size and style ([see Fabric options](#fabric))
  - Long sleeves, long legs, use of lining, larger measurements, more ease, use
    of a hood, and use of a skirt will all increase fabric requirements.
  - A typical adult unisuit with short sleeves and short legs with a self-lined
    body will take about 2 meters of fabric.
- (Optional) Rib knit fabric for the neck, arms, and legs, if desired.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

This pattern is designed to work with stretch/knit fabrics, such as swim
fabric, fleece, and jersey.

For unisuits, unitards, and other performance-oriented and form-fitting
garments, four-way stretch fabric such a 20% spandex blend is strongly
recommended. For more casual garments, such as one-piece fleece pajamas,
kigurumi, rompers, and jumpsuits, most knit fabrics can be used. Fleece can be
used to make warm winter pajamas, while jersey knit can be used to make a
summer romper.

The raglan sleeves lend themselves well to using different colors/prints for
the body and for the sleeves. Contrasting fabrics can also be used on the skirt
or hood.

Lined portions of the garment lend themselves well to embroidery, as the
stabilizer (strongly recommended) and stitching will be kept away from the
wearer's body by the lining. The chest, next to the zipper, is a particularly
good spot, both because it's prominent, and because the chest doesn't stretch
vertically much, since it's near the zipper.

With swim fabric/spandex, it is recommended to make the neckband out of the
same material used for the body. For less stretchy fabric, such as cotton
jersey knit, ribbing is recommended.
