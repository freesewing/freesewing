## What You Need {#needs}

To make Opal, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- Between 1 - 3 meters (1.1 - 3.3 yards) of a suitable fabric, depending on
  size and style ([see Fabric options](#fabric)).
- (optional) Fasteners to attach the straps to the front bib. I make my
  overalls using tack buttons on the bib, and a buckle and slider on each
  strap.

:::warning

- Long legs and a looser fit will increase fabric requirements. Pockets usually
  can be fit on the otherwise wasted portion of the fabric, and don't change
  the fabric length requirement.
- A pair of shortalls for a typical adult will need about 2 meters of fabric.

:tip
When cutting out two, you can cut them [good sides
together](/docs/sewing/good-sides-together). However, when working with fabric
with a pattern, I prefer to cut them individually to finely control the pattern
matching.

When you cut them individually, remember that they need to be mirror images of
each other. So flip either your pattern or your fabric over when cutting the
second one.
