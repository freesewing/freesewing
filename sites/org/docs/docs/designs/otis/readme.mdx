## What You Need {#needs}

To make Otis, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric Options](#fabric))
- 3 snaps.
- A little bit of interfacing if your fabric is very stretchy.

:::tip
You can use a different color fabric for the bindings to give it some
additional flair.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

Rompers are normally made from knit fabric. For best results, use a cotton
fabric with just one or two percent of spandex. Jersey works well if it has
good recovery.

### Interfacing

If your fabric has a lot of stretch, it is probably a good idea to put some
iron-on interfacing on the snap placket.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- **Main fabric**
  - Cut **1 back** part on fold
  - Cut **1 front** part on fold
  - Cut **2 shortSleeve ** parts on fold
    or
  - Cut **2 longSleeve** parts on fold
  - Cut **1 bindingBackNeck** part
  - Cut **1 bindingFrontNeck** part
  - Cut **2 bindingLeg** parts

:::tip
Depending on your fabric, it may be useful to add interfacing to the snap placket.
