## Designer Notes {#notes}

I made these because I wanted trousers to wear that were comfortable yet still
stylish.

They have pockets in the side seams, making this a relatively simple make for
trousers.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Paco, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1.25 meters (1.4 yards) (depending on your height) of a suitable fabric
  ([see Fabric options](#fabric))
- 30cm (12") of lining for the pocket bags
- A little bit of interfacing for the pocket welts (only needed if you opted
  for back pockets)
- A drawstring and two eyelets (optional)
- Enough wide flat elastic for your waist and cuffs

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

These work best in a lighter fabric with relatively good drape.

A light cotton, or chambray are particularly well-suited.
Rayon or jersey will work too, but will give it a more casual-look.

For the opposite effect, less casual and more style, you can consider a silk
blend or light wool.

:::tip Some things to avoid

Resist the temptation to make these in linen.
While linen is the go-to for hot summer days, I would not recommend it for these pants
as they come with an elasticated waist/cuffs, which means wrinkle hell.
Use one of out other designs with a fitted waist if you want linen pants.

Also avoid picking a fabric with a lot of stretch, for it will complicate
matters when you're installing the elastic.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

:::tip Cut out only what you need

Depending on the choices you made in your pattern, you may not need all parts.
If a pattern part is not printed, it means you don't need it.
:::

- From your main fabric:
  - 2x **part 1**: This is the back panel. Cut these from your **main fabric**
    with _good sides together_
  - 2x **part 2**: This is the front panel. Cut these from your **main fabric**
    with _good sides together_
  - 1x **part 3**: This is the waistband. Cut it from your **main fabric**
  - 2x **part 4**: This is the ankle cuff. Cut these, from your **main fabric**
    with _good sides together_ (not needed if your chose not to have an
    elasticated hem)
  - 2x **part 7**: This is the back pocket welt. Cut 2 of these from your
    **main fabric** with _good sides together_
- From your lining fabric:
  - 2x **part 5**: This is the front pocket bag. Cut these, from your **lining
    fabric** _on the fold_ (not needed if you chose to not have front pockets)
  - 2x **part 6**: This is the back pocket bag. Cut 2 of these from your
    **lining fabric** _on the fold_
- From interfacing:
  - 2x **part 8**: This is the back pocket welt interfacing. Cut 2 of these
    from **interfacing**

:::warning Caveats

- There is no seam allowance on the interfacing
- There is extra seam allowance on the waist band and hem
