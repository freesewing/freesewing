Paul is a standard sewing pattern for jeans and other pants with a similar cut.

Paul is heavily based on the Charlie design and also uses Titan as a base. The main differences between Charlie and Paul are:

- **Front pockets:** Paul uses front pockets with a curved opening instead of integrating the pockets into the side seam.
- **Back pockets:** Paul uses patch pockets on the back instead of double welt pockets.
- **Fly style:** Paul defaults to a button fly as opposed to Charlie's zipper fly.
- **Back construction:** Paul has a back yoke instead of darts.
- **Gusset:** Paul allows for a crotch gusset option.
- **Waistband:** Paul has a slightly higher waistband by default.
- **Legs:** Paul has tapered legs with a wider thigh and a smaller ankle circumference compared to charlie.

Other than that, both designs have pretty much the same construction, so if Charlie fits you well,
Paul should work the same. At least if you use the same measurements and make the same adjustments.
