title: 'Buttons'
---

This option lets you set the number of buttons inside the fly, not counting the button on the waistband.

Depending on how high your waist and how is, and how far your fly goes downwards, you may want to use more or less buttons.

Note that the button positions are just drawn on the pattern as a suggestion. Feel free to choose their final count and
position once you've constructed the fly.
