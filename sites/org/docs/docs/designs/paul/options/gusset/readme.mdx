title: 'Gusset'
---

Enable or disable the crotch gusset.

A crotch gusset provides added comfort, durability,
and flexibility by reducing stress at the seams and allowing for greater freedom of movement.

It can also reduce fabric usage, as the front and back pieces are narrower and more rectangular with the gusset enabled.

The main drawbacks are the need for an additional seam and a potential impact on the garment's appearance.
