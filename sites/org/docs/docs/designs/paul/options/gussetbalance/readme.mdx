title: 'Gusset Balance'
---

The gusset is constructed by removing a triangular shape from the front and back part of the pants and joining them
to a new part that forms the gusset.

This option controls if we should remove the same are from both parts, or if we should remove more from the back part.

The default is removing more from the back part, since the back part is usually larger.
Cutting the gusset too far from the front could be visible.
