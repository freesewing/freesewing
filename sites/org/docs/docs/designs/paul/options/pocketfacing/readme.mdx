title: 'Front Pocket Facing'
---

Enables or disables the pocket facing.

The pocket facing sits above the back of the front pockets
and ensures you normally don't see the pocket material from the outside.

On regular jeans, the pocket facing is the denim material on the inside and above the front pockets.
