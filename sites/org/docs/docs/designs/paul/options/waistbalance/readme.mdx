title: 'Waist balance'
---

Controls the distribution of fabric between front and back parts at the waist.

It is somewhat in vogue to draft a larger back panel these days.
Doing so shifts the side seam forward which gives the illusion of being slimmer.

This option allows you to control this balance.
