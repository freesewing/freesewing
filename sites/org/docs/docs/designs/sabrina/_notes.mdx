Sabrina is a simple pull-on sports bra, that gives light to medium support.

I have made a few as sports underwear for running to support my chest and prevent my nipples rubbing against my shirt.

Sabrina was developed from prototypes based on Breanna, but it uses a completely different construction and doesn't share any code.

If you've made Bruce or Shin or other patterns with curved seams and stretchy fabric,
Sabrina should be straightforward to make.
