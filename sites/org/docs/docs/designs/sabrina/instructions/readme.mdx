These instructions could need some drawings and more detailed instructions.
I'd be grateful if you improve them by clicking the link at the bottom on this page.

That said, Sabrina is very straightforward if you already made some similar designs.

:::note

As with all knits and stretch fabrics, but especially with slippery sports fabric,
a serger/overlock will make your life _much_ easier.
If you don't have one, use a stretch or zigzag stitch instead.

For the topstitching steps, a coverlock works best,
but if you don't have a coverlock, a twin needle will also give good results.
Of course, you can also use a zigzag stitch.

If you only have a standard sewing machine, and it is skipping stitches, try using a walking foot.

If you want to follow a visual guide, [this awesome YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0vkrKxWZk)
by Kim Dave follows a very similar design and was used as inspiration.

The main difference between Sabrina and her design is
that we're using additional side pieces for a better fit across the body.
:::

## Step 1: Create two bodies

- Serge both sides to the front, matching the notches, good sides together.

- Serge the back to both sides, matching the notches, good sides together.

- Join both shoulders, good sides together.

Do this twice to create one outer layer and one lining layer.

:::note
Optionally topstitch the seam allowances towards the back so they lay more flat.
:::

## Step 2: Join the bodies

- Turn the outer body good-side-out and insert the lining body (wrong side out) so the seams and wrong sides are hidden between both layers.

- Match up all the seams and raw edges join them together using clips.
  I **do not** recommend using pins, as they can create permanent holes.

## Step 3: Finish the neck and armholes

:::tip
As Kim Dave demonstrates in her video, if you want to add some removable padding to the bra,
you can trim some fabric from the front armholes of the lining piece and leave that unattached when
attaching the binding.
This way you're creating a hole which can be used to insert the padding.
You can also topstitch some lines onto the body to help with positioning the padding.
:::

Finish the neck and armholes using [knit binding](/docs/designs/aaron/instructions/#step-3-sew-knit-binding-to-the-front).

For this, cut 3 strips of your main fabric that are about 4 cm wide and as long as each opening.

First, match the raw edge(s) of the neck opening of your body with a raw edge of your neck opening strip.

Serge all three layers together without using the knife, keeping a few centimeters of fabric in the back of the neck unattached.

Join the binding on the back of the neck good sides together and join the remaining binding to the body.

Fold the strip to the bad side of the body and topstitch to secure the fold.
Make sure to use a stretch stitch or cover stitch for the top-stitching.

Repeat this for the armholes.

Trim surplus fabric on the inside.

Or use another method to finish the raw edges, like sewing on store-bought fold-over-elastic.

Whatever you do, make sure to stretch the binding you're attaching to the main body,
so that the openings are pulled together and don't stick up.

## Step 4: Attach the waistband

- Join the short sides of the waistband, good sides together, to create a loop.

- Fold it in half along the long side, so the wrong sides are together.

- Place and clip the raw edge of the loop onto the outside bottom raw edge of the bra body, matching the waistband seam to the center back of the bra body.

- Serge through all four layers on the bottom of the body. Make sure to not skip a layer. Leave an opening of around 5 cm (2 inches) on the center back.

- Cut some length of elastic to a size that feels good (is still comfortable while giving enough support) when you put it around your body at the under bust line / waist.
  Include two seam allowances in that length.
  The length should ideally be a little bit shorter than the waistband rectangle you've cut previously.
  **Don't** join the elastic band into a loop yet.

- Attach a safety pin to one end of the band and feed it through the waistband.

- Once you've made sure that the elastic sits flat inside the waistband (and you haven't accidentally twisted it),
  join both exposed ends of the elastic with your serger or sewing machine.

- Stretch the waistband to pull the elastic completely inside the waistband and serge the remaining length on the back closed.

- Fold the waistband down and the seam allowance up.

:::note

- Optional: Topstitch the seam allowance with a stretch- or cover-stitch to secure it in that upwards direction.

- Optional: Topstitch onto the waistband to stop the elastic from moving or twisting inside the tunnel.

## Step 5: Enjoy

Hooray, your Sabrina bra is finished!
