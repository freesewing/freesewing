## Designer Notes {#notes}

<Notes />

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Sabrina, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- A serger (overlock machine) is highly recommended
- Around 0.8 metres (0.9 yards) of suitable fabric
- An elastic band, 2–3 cm or about an inch wide, to go around your waist

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

This pattern is designed to work with two-way-stretch fabric.

Look for a fine, soft,
comfortable synthetic sports jersey with about 20–25% spandex that stretches well in both directions.

If you don't want to use it for sports, some cotton content is fine, too.

I like to use this [Hemmers Sports jersey](https://www.fabrics-hemmers.com/sports-jersey-taupe) (available in Europe).

I recommend using the same fabric for both layers,
but you can use some expensive printed fabric on the outside whilst using less expensive fabric for the lining.
You can also use softer, more skin-friendly fabric for the lining.
Your choice.

For prototypes, you can use some old t-shirt fabric or other inexpensive cotton jersey,
as long as it is stretchy enough.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

Sabrina's body is designed to be sewn twice and then used double layered with the seams hidden between both layers.
Therefore, you need twice the fabric of what you would normally expect.

If you prefer a thinner top, don't mind open seams or just want to create a prototype,
you can just use a single layer instead and skip the lining.

Be aware that a single layer will have less support/compression than a double layer bra.
