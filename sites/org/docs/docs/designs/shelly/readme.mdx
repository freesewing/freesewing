## What You Need {#needs}

To make Shelly, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- Between 0.5 - 2 meters (0.6 - 2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric, depending on
  size and style ([see Fabric options](#fabric))
  - A kids' short-sleeve rash guard can probably be made with 0.5 meters with
    fabric left over.
  - A looser-fitting long-sleeved swim shirt or t-shirt for a tall adult will
    take closer to 2 meters.
  - Two different colors or prints of fabric can be used (one for the sleeves,
    one for the bodice).
- (Optional) Ribbing fabric for the neck, if using less stretchy fabric.
- (Optional) Contrasting color thread, if making exposed seams.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

This pattern is designed to work with stretch/knit fabrics, particularly
spandex.

For swim shirts, rash guards, compression shirts, athletic shirts, and other
performance-oriented shirts, four-way stretch fabric is strongly recommended.
For more casual raglan t-shirts, two-way stretch jersey should work fine.

For compression clothes and swimwear, a 20:80 ratio of nylon/polyester to
spandex/elastane is recommended. More elastic fabrics allow for greater
negative ease, will give better mobility, and will be more forgiving to
measurement/design errors.

The raglan sleeves lend themselves well to using different colors/prints for
the body and for the sleeves.

With swim fabric/spandex, it is recommended to make the neckband out of the
same material used for the shirt. For less stretchy fabric, such as cotton
jersey knit, ribbing is recommended.
