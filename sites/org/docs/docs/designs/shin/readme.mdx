## What You Need {#needs}

To make Shin, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.75 meters (0.8 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- two eyelets and a drawstring

:::note A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life easier.

If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it. You
can use another technique for stretch seams, such as a zig-zag stitch, twin
needle, or elastic thread.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Swim trunks should be made out of a material with stretch that is suitable for
being in the water.

Typically, this falls apart in a few categories:

- Nylon mixed with elastane, spandex, or lycra is soft and stretchy. This is
  what most casual swimwear is made from.
- Polyester mixed with PBT (polybutylene terephthalate) is less soft to the
  touch, but resistant to chlorine and salt water. This is what a lot of
  competitive swimwear is made from.
- Neoprene, also known as scuba, is heavier and less stretchy. It's the stuff
  scuba suits are made from.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut **2 backs** with good sides together
- Cut **4 fronts** 2 x 2 with good sides together
- Cut **1 waistband**

:::warning Caveats

- To save paper, the waistband is not completely printed on the pattern since
  it's just a long rectangle. So look for the length indicator, and cut out a
  rectangle of that size.
- The hem allowance is double the standard seam allowance.
