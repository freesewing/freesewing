## What You Need {#needs}

To make Skully, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))
- Stuffing
- Embroidery floss for the hair
- Appropriately sized upholstery needle

:::note
This list is based on a default Skully and you may need less or more fabric
dependant on the [size you are making
Skully](/docs/designs/skully/options/size/).

For instance a 300% Skully will need 1.5 meters (0.5 meter x 300% = 1.5 meters)
and a 50% skully will need 0.25 meters (0.5 meter x 50% = 0.25 meters).

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

This plush toy is best made from a felt type of fabric. This will provide extra
rigidity to keep the shape correct, while still allowing it to be a plush toy.
Thin and stretchy fabrics are not well suited, because the shape will change
considerably due to tensions from the stuffing.

### Hair

Skully needs hair. Embroidery floss works very well, and can be had in all
colors.

### Stuffing

Since this is a plush toy, it will need to be stuffed with material. Most of
the time you'll want to use polyester fiberfill (polyfill), but if you have a
lot of fabric scraps, you can use shredded scrap fabric. However this may be
heavier and less soft than fiberfill. It's also worth thinking about whether
your Hi may be at risk of getting dirty, or want to go for a swim, as not all
stuffing options are washable.

### Needle

Skully has traded his sword for a needle. A needle this size is mostly sold as
upholstery needles. This will come in handy when doing some of the touch-ups at
the end of the construction.
