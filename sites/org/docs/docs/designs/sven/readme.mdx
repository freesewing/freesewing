## Designer Notes {#notes}

I don't knit, but I do tend to be cold all the time. So I do like sweaters.
Hence why I designed this sweater pattern, because I prefer to make clothes
rather than buy them.

It's a pretty simple design, essentially a light variation of the [Brian
block](https://freesewing.org/designs/brian) that it is based on.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Sven, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.75 meters (1.9 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- Ribbing fabric for the cuffs and neck opening

:::note A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life easier.

If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it.
Because these side seams and shoulder seams won't get stretched out, you can just sew them with a regular straight stitch.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Sven can be any sweatshirt you want it to be. From wovens to knit or even
scuba, you can't really go wrong as long as you stick with something that has a
bit of weight to it.

Have a look at [the Sven showcases](https://freesewing.org/showcase#filter="sven") for inspiration.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

Sven is a very simply pattern, and consists of two main parts plus some strips
for the neck and armhole binding.

- **Main fabric**
  - Cut **1 back** on the fold
  - Cut **1 front** on the fold
  - Cut **2 sleeves** with good sides together
- **Ribbing fabric**
  - Cut **1 strip** for the neck opening binding
  - Cut **2 strips** for the cuffs
  - Cut **1 strip** for the hem

:::warning Caveats
The ribbing parts are not included on the pattern because they're just
rectangular.
