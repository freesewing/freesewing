## Designer Notes {#notes}

<Notes />

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Tamiko, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric
  options](#fabric))

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

This pattern has a lot of unfinished edges, so you need something that does not
ravel. And you want to go for something with a nice drape.

Long story short, go for a knitted fabric, or some light scuba or something. No
wovens.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- **Main fabric**
  - Cut **1 Tamiko top** on the fold

Tamiko is a zero-waste pattern. It's a rectangle that's cut out on the fold.
Not more than that. There's only one part to this top, we will simply refer to
it at the **Tamiko top**. It needs to be cut on the fold along the bottom.

:::warning Caveats

- Cut out the armhole, but leave seam allowance
