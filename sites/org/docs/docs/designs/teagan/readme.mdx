## Designer Notes {#notes}

This is my go-to T-shirt pattern for most of my T-shirts.

It's not the classical T-shape but a bit more fitted with narrower and shorter
sleeves and a wider somewhat boat-neck style opening.

I like it. Maybe you will too.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Teagan, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](https://freesewing.org/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric
  options](#fabric))

:::tip A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life
easier. If you do not have one of those, don’t despair. You don’t really need
it. All serged seams on the Teagan T-shirt can also be sewn with a narrow
zigzag stitch (~2 mm wide) on a standard sewing machine.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

The Teagan T-shirt is designed as a close-fitting tee and is best suited to
knit fabrics with some stretch, such as jersey. Cotton knits are often an
easy-to-sew option for those new to knits. Rayon knits generally will have a
bit more drape and are more slippery to sew.

:::tip
If you're new to sewing, look for a knit with a few percent spandex for stretch
and recovery (snapping back after stretching). Fabric weights can also help you
make your choice. T-shirts are typically made in lightweight fabric. A weight
of 130-200 grams per square meter (or 4-6 ounces per square yard) is likely to
be about right.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut 1 back on the fold.
- Cut 1 front on the fold.
- Cut 2 sleeves _with good sides together_
  - If you cut sleeves separately, remember that one has to be a mirror image
    of the other.
- Cut 1 strip for neck opening. It should be 6 cm wide and the length of your
  neck opening.

:::warning Caveats

- There is no seam allowance on the neck opening.
- There is extra hem allowance at the hem and armholes.
