Tiberius was the first of the bunch, and also the simplest: a simple, nice
_tunica_, inspired by the ones worn by Romans in the late republic, early
empire (I can tell you that I read quite a lot of references and looked at
pictures of statues and reliefs to figure out the "how long should it be?"
question). This was a garment I wanted to make as part of a costume for my
TTRPG (table-top roleplaying game) character, who is kind of a fantasy Roman.

While writing down my measurements to make the _tunica_, I realised that this
was such a simple parametric design that it could be a way for me to dip my
toes into the coding part of Freesewing. And so I did. Even though it's "only"
a rectangle, I tried to put some things into it behind the scenes (seams?),
some failchecks to ensure that it results in a wearable garment. Since it's
only a rectangle, there is not much wriggle room (pun intended) for fit, making
it nice and easy but also challenging when you want to achieve a certain look
(the length of the apparent "sleeves", for example).

One slightly hidden feature is the possibility to add positional markers for
_clavi_, strips of colour on the _tunica_ to denote rank and/or class. Quite
fascinating,

The name is taken from James T. Kirk, by the way, who luckily had parents who
seemingly liked some debatable Roman emperors.
