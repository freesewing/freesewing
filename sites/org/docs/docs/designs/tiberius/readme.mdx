## What You Need {#needs}

To make Tiberius, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 2 meters (2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric options](#fabric))
- (a belt, for wearing it)

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Tiberius can be made out of almost any woven fabric. Historically "accurate"
would be linen, wool, and, to an extent, cotton. If you care about
authenticity, research this a bit. In any case, natural fibers without any
stretch are the way to go.

Depending on the social status you want to portray, choose coarser or finer
fabrics. Different colours are also possible.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

:::tip

##### Use the power of the _paperless_ option - do **not** print this pattern

Tiberius is just a big rectangle, so printing the pattern out is a bit of a
waste. Save a tree, toggle the
[paperless](/docs/about/site/draft#paperless) option, and copy
the dimensions to your fabric, while respecting the grainline.

:::

Tiberius consists of only one part, the _tunica_, that will act as a pattern
for both front and back pieces.

- cut _2 tunicae_, _on the fold_

:::note Notes
You have two options here: Either you cut your tunica in two pieces as
described above, or you cut it in only one piece. Historically speaking, the
time period or location you're aiming for can make a difference (ancient Rome
vs. ancient Greece, for example). If you care about authenticity, I suggest
researching this a bit.
