## Designer Notes {#notes}

Tristan is a fitted top with corset-inspired design elements.

It’s the result of a collaboration between Wouter and Natalia. This was a dream
come true for me, Natalia, because I think Wouter is brilliant.

The original version had a lace-up back and was made for the Renaissance fair.
I made it by tracing a new neckline and armholes on Noble directly on the body.
Wouter thought it looked nice and we decided to turn it into a published
standalone top design, with Wouter doing the code. Many messages, sketches, and
mock-ups later, the result is Tristan.

Tristan allows the user a lot of control over the options. It’s a great
introduction to prince(ss) seams, and since it doesn’t use a lot of fabric,
could be a good project to use up scraps. Although Tristan has options for
corset-inspired lacing, it is not intended to be historically accurate.

I chose the name “Tristan top” because I wanted something that sounded romantic
and pretty and followed the traditional FreeSewing convention of a first name
that starts with the same letter as the type of design.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Tristan, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable main fabric (see [Fabric
  options](#fabric)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable lining fabric (if lining)
- Choice of closure - either **Zipper**, or **eyelets**, **reinforcement for
  the eyelets**, and **lacing**
- If finishing with bias binding, **Bias tape** (about 4 meters (4.4 yards))

:::tip Tips

##### Use a separating zipper

We recommend a separating invisible zipper for this garment. Using a separating
zipper will make it easier for you to take the top on and off.

##### When making Tristan with the lacing option, reinforce the eyelets

When making Tristan with the lacing option, make sure you reinforce the
eyelets. A binding, or sewn in interfacing could work to do so. Adding boning
between the eyelets and the seam is another option.

Tristan is not a corset, and therefore doesn't require heavy boning. We would
recommend using a flexible type of boning. That would create the neatest
opening. Otherwise a double layer of hair canvas and put the eyelets close to
the seam. Both would require lining, or an adequately sized hem or binding.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Tristan is designed for woven fabrics with little to no stretch.

For the **main fabric**, you can use most non-stretch fabrics, such as poplin,
jacquard, or linen. Even quilting cotton will work. Fabrics with some structure
will work best.

For the **lining**, if you would like a firm structure even without the use of
boning, use a strong fabric, such as canvas, twill, or denim. Use something
that will be comfortable against the skin.

:::tip Consider using contrasting fabrics
Consider using different fabrics for the inside and outside panels to highlight
the prince(ss) seams.
