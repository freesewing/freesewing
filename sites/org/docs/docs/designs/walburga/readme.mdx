## Designer Notes {#notes}

<Notes />

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Walburga, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- (optional) about 3 metres (3.3 yards) of bias tape or trimmings to finish the
  raw edges

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Walburga can be made out of almost any woven fabric. Historically "accurate"
would be linen, wool, and, to an extent, cotton. If you care about
authenticity, research this a bit. In any case, natural fibers without any
stretch are the way to go.

Depending on the social status you want to portray, choose coarser or finer
fabrics. Different colours are also possible.

If you want to embroider or appliqu√© on your Walburga, make sure that your main
fabric will support your design.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

Walburga consists of two parts, a _front_ and a _back_ piece.

:::tip
Apart from the cutout for the neck opening, front and back are identical. It is
therefore enough to print only the front part.
:::

- cut _1 front_, _on the fold_
- cut _1 back_, _on the fold_
