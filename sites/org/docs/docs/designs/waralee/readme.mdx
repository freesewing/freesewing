## Designer Notes {#notes}

Waralee is one of those designs that you just make because it's easy, and you
feel like there must be tons of other people who would love to make wrap pants.
And where can you find wrap pants with pockets? And who wants pants without
pockets?

The construction is easy when you make it without pockets. And with them, it's
still not that hard for a practiced sewist.

Keep in mind that `waralee` is basically two large rectangles, and you can
easily make them by transferring the pattern onto fabric by using the
dimensions, and not printing out all the pages. Turn off the `expand` option in
the core settings and you'll get a page with all the dimensions on it to mark
your fabric. And a handy template for the crotch cut-out is provided too.

These wrap pants are lovely in warm weather, specially when made from linen.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Waralee, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 2 meters (2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))
- Some interfacing for the waistband and pockets (if making pockets).

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Wrap pants are a bit casual and perfect for warm weather.
This is a type of wrap pants, which leaves the sides of your legs exposed at
times. And as such, it is mostly worn in warmer weather, or inside.

To get a good effect of the flowing of the legs, don't use very heavy
materials. Good types of fabric are **linen**, and **linen blends**. These
mostly have a nice drape and are cool. Heavy materials like denim are less
useful so should be avoided.

You can't go wrong
with **linen**, although **cotton** is a good option too.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

:::note

Waralee consists of two mirrored pieces of fabric. They are basically big
rectangles with pieces missing. As such, it is easier to print out the part
you need to cut out and measure the rest, than it is to print out everything
and cut the pattern the traditional way.

That said, the pattern is available both ways. So you can print out the whole
thing, tape all the pages together, and use that to cut out the fabric, if you
prefer. But we recommend only printing the part that you need to cut out.

You will need to print out the pockets and pocket facings in the traditional way.
:::

- **Main fabric**
  - Cut **2 pants** parts.
  - Cut **2 long strap** parts.
  - Cut **2 short strap** parts.

Optional (pockets)
**Main fabric**

- Cut **4 frontFacing** parts
- Cut **4 backFacing** parts
  **Lining fabric**
- Cut **2 frontPocket** parts on the fold.
- Cut **4 backPocket** parts

:::tip
You can cut the Pocket and backPocket parts out of a lining fabric if you
prefer but this will only be needed if you deviate from the recommended main
fabrics.
:::

Pattern part 2 is just for when you want to make the pants without printing
everything. Since this is just a couple of rectangles (with a slanted side),
you can just use a ruler to cut out the main part. Then you use Part 2 to cut
out the crotch part. Save a tree.

Part 2 has a negative seam allowance, since you'll be using it opposite of what
you normally use the pattern parts for.

If you opt for the cut-out method, use the paperless view to see all the
dimensions of the pattern. You will need to cut a narrow strip out from what
will become the front, and a small triangle and strip from what will become the
back. And in the middle between these will be the little cut-out pattern
piece. Make sure you measure this correctly, and you have the fabric squared
before you start cutting.

Of course, you'll need to cut out the straps too. They're just simple long
rectangles.
