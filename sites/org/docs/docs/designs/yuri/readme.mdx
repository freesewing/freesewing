## Designer Notes {#notes}

The idea behind Yuri was to get a hybrid cardigan/sweatshirt that could be
easily opened and closed, and sewn without the hassle of zips. When I started
sewing, one of the things I hated the most was sewing zips (but now it's ok,
yay!).

I wanted a big shape that would be comfortable to wear while cycling or
knitting on the couch, plus size or not, with or without breasts :smiley:

This pattern was made in collaboration with @biou, my husband, who's also a
programmer. We had a lot of fun creating and testing the pattern together and
we were happy to be able to contribute a little to FreeSewing :smiley:

We used a mix of the two Huey & Hugo hoodies and reshaped them a bit to change
the front/opening and length, and BAM, Yuri was born!

I recommend using a soft sweatshirt fabric, you can add a lining but it's not
essential. It can be nice in red for a little red hood costume, or a nice gift
for a pregnant person :smiley:

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Yuri, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 2.5 meters (2.8 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](#fabric))
- 2 large buttons

:::tip A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life
easier.

If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it.
Because none of the seams get stretched out, you can just sew this pattern with
a regular straight stitch.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

You may find a dedicated sweatshirt/tracksuit fabric section in your fabric
store of choice. If you don't, just head for the knitwear section and look for
a thicker comfortable knit fabric.

As far as fibers go, you can go all cotton, or opt for a poly or acryl cotton
blend.

Make sure to pay attention to the inside of the fabric. Sweatshirt fabrics come
in loopback and brushed back. If you want that OMG-it-feels-so-soft-on-my-skin
feeling, go for brushed.

:::tip

You don't have to use sweatshirt fabric. Other options are available, from
fashion-forward neoprene (aka scuba) to a more eyebrow-rising choice like
crushed velour (aka velvet).

Or if you have given up on class, you could go for fleece.
