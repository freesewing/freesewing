A coverlock is a type of sewing machine that is dedicated to do a coverlock
stitch, or coverlock seam.

A coverlock seam is used for hemming knit garments. It finishes the folded back
fabric so it can't ravel and the resulting stitch can stretch along with the
fabric.

Coverlocks can be dedicated machines, or they can be integrated in an
overlock/serger.
