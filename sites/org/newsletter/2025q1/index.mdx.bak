## üéâ  Happy New Year

I would like to start by wishing you a happy New Year. 2025 is officially here,
and it's kind of an exciting year as far as numbers go.
For one thing, 2025 is 45 squared (45¬≤), which is rare as far as years go, as
44¬≤ happened way back in 1936, and 46¬≤ won't be here until 2116.

But there's more, because 2025 is also the sum of the cube of all single digits
(1¬≥+2¬≥+3¬≥+4¬≥+5¬≥+6¬≥+7¬≥+8¬≥+9¬≥), and it also happens to be [a Harshad
number](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshad_number).

Wikipedia tells me that:

> _harshad comes from the Sanskrit har·π£a (joy) + da (give), meaning joy-giver_

So, my optimistic interpretation is that 2025 announces itself as a year that
is supposed to bring joy.

My only wish is that the numbers don't lie and that indeed this year will bring
you lots of joy.

## üèÜ How did we do in 2024?

FreeSewing passed a non-trivial milestone in 2024, when we passed the 100k
activated user accounts on FreeSewing.org.  As I'm writing this, our website
has 106.734 activated user accounts. That's a lot. As a matter of fact, the
growth of the site has caused issues big and small as we needed to scale up and
sometimes adapt the way things are handled behind the scenes to deal with the
scale. We've got a good handle on things, and I expect we'll be culling older
accounts throughout the year, so this is not something that has me worried.

2024 was also the first (full) year since we switched to a pay-what-you-want model.
Revenue for the year clocked in at 10.386,63 euro, which is slight increase
over the year before (1.6% increase over 2023's 10.222,07 euro).

I am happy about that number, but it's also a source of worry because the ever
increasing number of users does not translate in any sort of meaningful way to
more fincancial support. In other words, an increasingly smaller percentage of our
users are the ones who make it all possible, and that concerns not only because
it's a small minority but also because my feeling is that this group skews
heavily to users who have been with us for longer.

In other words, I do have some concerns for the longer term future. But I
prefer to focus on the positive and more than 10k [going to those who need it
most](https://freesewing.org/docs/about/pledge) is certainly reason to be thankful.

## ‚úÖ What are we doing in 2025?

Version 4 of FreeSewing, that's what we're doing.
Yes, the next major release is on its way, altough it needs more time in the
over before it's really to be consumed.

The instigator for the new major release is that we'll drop support for NodeJS
18, and expect at least version 20 going forward.  We use the so-called LTS
release (long term support) which is recommended for production deployments.
The end-of-life date for version 18 is the end of April of this year, so by
that time we will move to v4 and NodeJS 20, which nesitates a major version bump.

We are of course using the opportunity to make some other (breaking) changes,
although those changes will be minimal in our core library and designs.

The majority of the changes will be in how we manage _all the other stuff_.
From the very start, we've focussed on making it easy for contributors to
create and add their own designs, and that's proven very successful.
FreeSewing's _collection_ of designs has grown not only in absolute numbers,
but also in the amount of different people who have contributed them.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the other things that keep
FreeSewing ticking. Like the various websites, and backend code, and all the
many things big and small that make FreeSewing what it is. We have great
contributors who are eager to help out, but historically the focus is
always been on providing tools, documentation, guidance, and handrails to
create designs. When it comes to working on the website or backend code,
documentation is often lacking, and it's just a lot harder to get involved with
that aspect of the project.

That is of course entirely my fault. For all the work that went into making it
easy for people to contribute designs, no similar effort was undertaken for the
other aspects of the project.

So, that will be my personal focus in 2025, and the upcoming v4 release will be
a big part of that.
