## üéâ FreeSewing v4 was released today

The next major version of FreeSewing, version 4, has been in the works for a
while, and I _really_ wanted to get it out the door before sending out this
newsletter, so that's exactly what I did.

As this is a major version, there are breaking changes, but we've really kept
it to a minimum. There's only one real breaking change:

- FreeSewing now requires NodeJS 20 or newer

In other words, we've dropped support for NodeJS 18, which will reach
end of life at the end of next month.

A lot of work went into this new major release, especially in the realm of our
frontend code, where we made a huge effort to make it more maintainable.
This is the kind of thing that mostly happens under the hood, but will allow
us to increase the project's volatility and shorten our (non-major) release
cycle.

What this means is that everything's changed, and nothing has changed.
I've compared it to your favorite restaurant moving across the street. It's a
different building, different kitchen, different everything. But your favorite
waitress is still there serving that same food you've know and love.

That, in a nutshell, is FreeSewing v4.

## ü§ì Announcing the new FreeSewing Studio

We have created a new standalone development environment named _FreeSewing
Studio_.
In practical terms, this means that we have replaced `@freesewing/new-design`
with `@freesewing/studio`.

If you're unfamiliar, this is our development environment that people can use
to generate FreeSewing designs.
In v3, this development environment only supported a single design, and so
`new-design` made sense.

Now in v4, our development environment not only ships with all FreeSewing
designs on board, but you can add your own, and as many as you want.

In addition, it also integrates with the FreeSewing backend, so you do not only
have access to all your measurements, you can also store your patterns in our
backend, even from your custom designs.

To try it out yourself, run:

```
npx @freesewing/studio
```

## üëã Bye bye Vercel/NextJS

We have been using NextJS for several years now for the FreeSewing frontends.
However, as I mentioned in an earlier edition of this newsletter, Vercel (the
company behind NextJS) has revoked their sponsorship. This was nothing against
FreeSewing, they've revoked all open source plans, but without their
sponsorships, the cost of hosting our websites on Vercel is rather steep, and
it was not sustainable for us to stay with them.

Furthermore, Vercel is also increasingly tying NextJS to their hosted offering,
making it harder to _just go elsewhere_.

Since documentation is a critical (and large) part of both our website for
makers and developers, we've decided to migrate to Docusaurus, which is highly
optimized for documentation, but flexible enough that we can still do all the
more advanced stuff that we need.

To improve maintainability and facilitate code reuse between our websites and
new studio, we've abstracted all of our frontend logic into various components
in our new `@freesewing/react` package which now underpins all our frontends.

This was a huge effort, and we are lagging behind with developer documentation,
which is something which we'll work on going forward.

Apart from that, I'm certain there will be some rough edges, but things
_should just work_ and if not, make sure to let us know.

## üòü Putting some distance between our users and the new US administration

Part of the reason that we were only able to drag v4 over the finish line at the
very last minute is that our planning was thrown into turmoil by the need to
put distance between our user's data and the US administration.

I will talk about our reasons for doing so at the end of this newsletter.
Here, I will instead focus on what we actually did.

Essentially, we have moved everything that is potentially sensitive to brand
new infrastructure in Europe, using European companies, rather than US-based
companies. Specifically:

- We've moved our backend systems from DigitalOcean in the US to Scaleway in Germany
- We've moved our software repositories from GitHub in the US to Codeberg in Germany
- We've moved our transactional email service from AWS in the US to Scaleway in Germany (ongoing)
- We have put a de-facto freeze on our Instagram account, and recommend you
  follow our accounts on [freesewing.social](https://freesewing.social/), our
  Mastodon instance hosted in Germany.
- We have re-visited our choice to use Discord as the de-facto place for the
  FreeSewing community, and have instead decided that here too we would step
  both to safeguard the data of our users, as well as embrace the open web. So
  we've created a forum for the FreeSewing community (more on that below).
- While freesewing.org will continue to work as expected, we will henceforth
  use freesewing.eu as our main domain name.

All of these changes are already active, although some need some time to
percolate to completion.

None of this will impact you as a user of the site. So, you may find this
overkill. But people trust us with their data, and we feel a moral
obligation to safeguard that data even from a potential adversarial
administration in the US.

## üí¨ Announcing the FreeSewing Forum

The idea that a _good old forum_ would arguably be a better for for the
FreeSewing community than the social network of the day is not new, it's
something that has always held true.

However, we were always reluctant to take on the additional burden of
operating/maintaining/managing/moderating such a forum, because, well there's
only 24 hours in a day.

However, given the efforts we are making to keep our user's data out of the
reach of the US administration, it felt like the time was right to do it.

And so we did. The official FreeSewing forum lives at
[forum.freesewing.eu](https://forum.freesewing.eu/) and you can (and should)
use your FreeSewing account for authentication.

It's a bit empty still, so don't be shy and come say hello.

## üîê FreeSewing as an OIDC provider

This is a bit of a nerdy sidebar, but to allow the forum to work with your
FreeSewing account, we needed to adapt our backend and turn FreeSewing into an
OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.

This opens the door to _sign in with your FreeSewing account_ functionality on
any website, just as on our forum.
We do not have any concrete plans for this, or rather, our own needs are met.
But if you are interested in letting FreeSewing users sign in with their
FreeSewing account (and for example access their measurements) then you can
reach out to us to discuss.

## ‚úä Don't Panic - Organize!

Last but not least, I want to talk about why we moved everything to Europe.

With everything that is going on right now ‚Äî _gestures vaguely in the
direction of the current US administration_ ‚Äî it's tempting to throw up our
hands in despair, spend our days doomscrolling, or just check out somehow.

Unfortunately, that's not going to cut it for we are way into uncharted
territory here.

I was born long after the end of the second world war, but still, my entire
worldview along with everyone around me was shaped by what happened during and
in the aftermath of _the great war_. The atrocities of the Nazi regime are not
up for debate. My grandfather fought the Nazis in the trenches.
I grew up mere miles away from the only place in Europe were
resistance fighters were able to stop a train full of Jewish people on route to
the Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz. Some real evil stuff happened, and it
happened right here where we live, to people who were still around when we grew
up.

From their role in defeating the Nazi regime, to the Marshall plan
to rebuild post-war Europe, our gratitude, appreciation, and yes admiration
of the United States is something that was always there, unquestioned.
You can't throw a stone around here without hitting a square named
after an American President, a street named in honor of one of its military
regiments, and so on. The US could do no wrong. Its status as an ally and the
superpower we would be aligned with come what may, was something no sane person
would question.

Today, just over two months into the second term of the Trump administration,
everything is on the table. Nothing is sacred. Nobody knows how far things will
unravel.

It is all very scary, so what do we do?

One of the houses on the street I used to live on had a large banner attached
to the back of the house, facing the railroad that passes behind it. The
banner protests a planned railroad extension, an extension that calls for the
demolition of several houses on the street. I doubt many commuters know the
reason that banner is there, because it doesn't explain any of this. Instead,
it's a hand-drawn two-panel comic of a big fish chasing some small fish, only
for the small fish to assemble in the shape of an even bigger fish in the next
panel, and reverse the chase.

Now that I live in Antwerp, I pass that banner every time I commute to work,
and I remain impressed by its simple yet effective and timeless message. You
see, it's a powerful image on its own, but it really drives the point home with
its companion slogan: _Niet panikeren - Organiseren_ which translates as:
_Don't panic. Organize!_

Things are wild right now. I do not know what will happen next, but I do know
that I am not comfortable with the idea of having our user's data under the
legislative reach of an administration that is increasingly authoritarian with
a particular penchant to go after trans people, of which we count many among
our users.

A lot of people voted for President Trump. Realistically, several of you did too.
I am certain you had your reasons, and those reasons are valid. The vote is
sacred. You do you.

But if ‚Äî like me ‚Äî you are rather
worried about everything that is happening right now,
I hope you will not panic, but instead organize.
