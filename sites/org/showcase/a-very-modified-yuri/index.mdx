RockerKitten modified Yuri to make this cozy and cute robe. They changed the neck line, lengthened the front hood, and made the whole thing floor length. They shared:

> it was exactly the type of hood I wanted, and the perfect base. I hate drafting sleeve caps and armscyes so that's what I use the most of ðŸ˜„
> I was really really really happy that the hood fit lol. I NEVER find hoods that fit

Yay! Love the way they took Yuri's base design and made it their own.
