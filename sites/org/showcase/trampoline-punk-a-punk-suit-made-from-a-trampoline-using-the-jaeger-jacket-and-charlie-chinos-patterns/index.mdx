Trampoline Punk attempts to answer the question "Can you sew a formal suit from a trampoline?" The answer: sort of, but you have to be willing to bleed for it. The formal jacket and pants are sewn from the family's trampoline that was destroyed in a 2023 windstorm. The dress shirt and patchwork skull are sewn from the designer's 22-year-old wedding dress. The garment features punk detailing such as DIY patches, safety pin embellishments, and chains from the trampoline rigging. Don't try this at home unless you are willing to sacrifice several sewing machine needles, your favorite scissors, and most of the skin on your hands.
