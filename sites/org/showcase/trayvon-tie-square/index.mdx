It's my first time sewing anything and sewing as a guy not encouraged in my
family but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I admittedly still don't
quite understand interfacing, and felt overwhelmed with trying to find a scrap
tie I could use; so instead I cut up a bunch of left over N95 Masks and
stitched them together into the tie interface pattern.
