Well that escalated quickly. We published [our Florence Face Mask
pattern](/designs/florence/) at the end of last month, hoping it would be
helpful. Now, [hospitals are actively reaching out to people to beg them to
make fabric face masks for their staff](https://www.uza.be/mondmaskers).

So obviously, we want to help:

- PDF pattern for our Florence face mask:
  - A4 facemask pattern
  - Letter facemask pattern
- [Instructions for the facemask pattern](/docs/designs/florence/instructions/)

No go and make a bunch. Our healthcare workers are counting on you!
