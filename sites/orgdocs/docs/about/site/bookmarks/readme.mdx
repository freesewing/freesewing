FreeSewing bookmarks work just like in your browser. You can bookmark
documentation pages, measurements sets, or patterns and we will keep track of
them for you.

This can be handy not only to refer to documentation you use often, but also to
bookmark (public) patterns or measurements sets from other FreeSewing users.

A FreeSewing bookmark has the following fields:

- [Title](#title)
- [Type](#type)
- [Location](#location)

## Title

Every bookmark has a **title** attribute that is mandatory.

In other words, you must give each of your bookmarks a title, but that title
can be anything you want.

## Type

Every bookmark has a **type** attribute that is mandatory.

When you manually create a bookmark, the type is always **custom** so you
cannot choose it.

Other types include **pattern**, **doc**, or **set** which will automatically
be set when you bookmark a pattern, documentation page, or measurements set
respectively.

## Location

Every bookmark has a **location** attribute that is mandatory. It holds the URL
of the bookmark.

A bookmark without a location or URL is useless, as this holds the location the
bookmark should point to.
