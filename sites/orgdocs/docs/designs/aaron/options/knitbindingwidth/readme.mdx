title: Knit binding width
---

Controls the width of the knit binding on Aaron.

The default knit binding width is 6 x the seam allowance. For metric users
with the default 1cm seam allowance, this results in a 1.5cm wide knit binding
which is a good value.

For imperial users (who have a default seam allowance of 0.5") or users who
choose to use a larger seam allowance, the value of 6 time the seam allowance
will probable result in a knit binding that it too wide, so this option allows
you to control that.

:::note
This option is expressed in percentage of the seam allowance. So the default is
600%, or 6 time the seam allowance.
