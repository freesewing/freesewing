## Designer Notes {#notes}

Aaron is -- like most patterns I design -- born out of necessity. I needed an
A-shirt to wear under shirts when it gets a bit colder, and I try to only wear
clothes made from FreeSewing patterns, so Aaron was born.

Aaron's been around for many years and has been made by several people, so you
can consider this a staple of FreeSewing's design catalogue.

On it's own, it's a rather straight-forward design. It extends [the Brian
block](https://freesewing.org/designs/brian) and has an array of options to tweak the outcome,

There's a few things that are _special_ about Aaron, FreeSewing trivia if you will:

- Aaron is what I refer designers to when they have questions on how to do
  something. It's always first in the list (because it starts with double A),
  always the first to get new features, be migrated to a new version, and so
  on. Aaron is sort of FreeSewing's canary design. Everything that happens
  happens to Aaron first.
- I named this design `aaron` in memory of [Aaron
  Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz). Rest in peace brother.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Aaron, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.75 meters (0.8 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric
  options](#fabric))

:::note

#### A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life
easier.

If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it.
Because these side seams and shoulder seams won't get stretched out, you can
just sew them with a regular straight stitch.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

An A-shirt is essentially underwear. And in that capacity, you want something
that is comfortable, feels nice on your skin and breaths.

Cotton with a hint of something stretchy, maybe rayon, or a fine knit. I
suggest you go to the fabric store and feel around a bit.

:::note
While stretch is not required, it does make sense for underwear. That being
said, you can make this in a non-stretch, just make sure pick loose or casual
fit.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut **1 back** on the fold
- Cut **1 front** on the fold
- Cut **3 strips** for neck opening and armhole binding

:::warning

#### Caveats

- There is no seam allowance on the armholes
- There is no seam allowance on the neck opening
- There is extra hem allowance at the hem
