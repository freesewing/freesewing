## Designer Notes {#notes}

I made Bee together with Prudencerabbit, as they wanted to make a swimwear pattern that went along with a previous freesewing pattern.
It is based on a garment they made and wanted to make available for other people make as well.
We worked of FreeSewing's body block Bella as a base, converting it to a single dart block to make the top.
During pattern testing one of our contributors TangerineShark made a variant with crossover back ties which we found so cool we added it to Bee!
You can get this variation by using [option Cross Back Ties](/docs/designs/bee/options#crossbackties).
Bee can also be made reversible by using options [Reversible](/docs/designs/bee/options#reversible) & [Duo Colours Ties](/docs/designs/bee/options#duocolorties).
With the previous pattern being retired you can use [Uma](/docs/designs/uma) to make a matching bikini bottom.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Bee, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 - 1 metre (0.6 - 1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Bee Fabric options](/docs/designs/bee#fabric))
- (Optional) About 0.5 - 1 metre (0.6 - 1.1 yards) of lining fabric ([see Bee Fabric options](/docs/designs/bee#fabric))
- (Optional) Ribbons/Tapes/Cords for neck ties and bands, with the same length and width as neck tie and/or band.

:::note
The lining fabric is only needed if you want to make this pattern reversible. If you don't, you only need the main fabric.
You can use a serger/overlocker to construct this pattern but it is not mandatory.
Ribbons/Tapes/Cords can be used instead of making custom ties. Just make sure to get more than you need and that you cut down to size after construction.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main and Lining Fabric

The main and lining fabric are the same type of material. Bee is made with swimwear fabrics such as lycras.

:::note
You only need lining fabric if you intend to make the pattern reversible or if you want the band for the cross back tie variant to be a contrasting fabric. Otherwise you can cut all the required pieces from your main fabric.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

There are three style options which can be combined to produce a
variety of patterns.

1. Fastening style
   - **Regular ties**: two band ties and two neck ties fasten the bikini.
   - **Cross back ties**: two neck ties cross behind the back and thread
     through the ends of the bikini bottom to fasten the bikini.
2. Reversibility
   - **Reversible**: the fronts and backs of the bikini cups are two
     different colors.
   - **Non-reversible**: the fronts and backs of the bikini cups are one
     single color.
3. Tie colors
   - **Single Color Ties**: the neck ties and band or band ties are one
     single color.
   - **Two Colours**: the neck ties and band or band ties are two
     different colors.

:::note
This pattern is easily made reversible by buying a similar fabric to the main fabric and using it as contrast. To save confusion on instructions it will be referred to as the "lining fabric".
