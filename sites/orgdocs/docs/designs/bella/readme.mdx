## Designer Notes {#notes}

This block was a collaboration between myself and an industry insider who prefers to remain anonymous because of her profession.

It is the parametric version of a base block for womenswear that is used in the industry in Italy to design womenswear.
However, while the block will adapt to your measurements, the original block that it is based on is in really not suitable for a very wide sizing range.

So your mileage may very here, especially when you are further from the kind of skinny ladies Italians tend to design for.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Bella, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 metres (0.6 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Bella Fabric options](/docs/designs/bella/fabric/))

This list is for a default Bella Block. If you have/are making changes to the block you may need to get additional items such as closures, binding etc.

:::note

###### Bella is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

If you are making a default Bella to see how it fits we recommend a fabric such as **Calico (Muslin)** or a cheaper fabric that matches the drape and stretch of the fabric you intend to make a finalised version of Bella with.

You can use scraps of fabrics from your stash so don't worry about buying fabric specifically for Bella.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

**Main fabric**

- Cut **1 Front** part on the fold.
- Cut **2 Back** parts.

:::note

These cutting instructions are just for the default Bella block. Adjust your cutting accordingly if you have/are making changes to the block.

:::tip

If you do not have someone to help pin you into Bella then you may find it easier to Cut 2 Front parts with seam allowance and sew the backs up when constructing so you can pin in the front.
