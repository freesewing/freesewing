How much sleevecap ease do you want?

> #### What's the point?
>
> The amount of sleevecap ease determines how the sleeves rolls from the shoulder.
>
> More ease makes the sleeve curl into the seam as you would expect from a coat. Less ease makes the sleeve lie flatter.

> The lighter your fabric, the less sleevecap ease you want.
