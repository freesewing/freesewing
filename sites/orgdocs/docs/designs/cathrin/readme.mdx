## Designer Notes {#notes}

Cathrin is a side-effect of a project that never went anywhere.

I was going to make an elaborate dress, and I needed a corset to wear under it.
So I did some research online, and I found [this tutorial by Cathrin
Åhlén](https://katafalk.wordpress.com/2010/06/24/underbust-pattern-tutorial/)
on drafting an underbust corset.

So, I essentially implemented those instructions in code, and the rest is
history as the original project got abandoned.

This design is named `cathrin` after Cathrin Åhlén who taught me (and others)
how to draft such a thing.

## What You Need {#needs}

Corsets are easier to construct than they seem, however they need several
specialist items and tools.

You will need BONING. Historic corsets used whale bone to stiffen corsets.
Modern corset makers use steel. You can get steel bones either as flat steel
and spiral steel - do research, as different types of corset and different
corset makers have their own preferences. Plastic bones are also a cheaper
option.

You can find a good guide to other tools at [Foundations
Revealed](https://foundationsrevealed.com/).

Sample supplies list:

- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of core fabric (see [Fabric Options](#fabric))
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of outer fabric (see [Fabric Options](#fabric))
- Boning
- Grommets (size 2)
- About 2 meters of bias tape
- About 3 meters of lacing
- Tools: Grommet setter, awl

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Corsets must be made from fabric with no stretch at all.

For the core fabric, you need a strong fabric, such as coutil, canvas, or
denim.

For the outer fabric, you can use most non-stretch fabrics, such as linen,
cotton, or silk.
:::note
The fabric designed for corset making is called coutil. Although coutil is
expensive, not much is needed for a corset. Some cheaper alternatives include
canvas, denim and cotton ticking. However, these will stretch over time and are
not suitable for any garment with a large waist reduction: they are not strong
enough. They are good options for testing the pattern to see how it fits on
you.

For corsets made from silk and cotton and other fancy fabrics, you need to use
several layers - the fabric you want to be seen, on top of a layer of coutil or
other strength layer, and perhaps also a third layer made out of lining which
will sit next to the body.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

Cut 1 core fabric and 1 outer fabric of the center panel, making sure to cut on
the fold.

Cut 2 core and 2 outer of each side panel with _good sides together_.

For example, for the 11-panel version of Cathrin:

- Panel 1 - Cut 1 core and 1 outer
- Panel 2 - Cut 2 core and 2 outer
- Panel 3 - Cut 2 core and 2 outer
- Panel 4 - Cut 2 core and 2 outer
- Panel 5 - Cut 2 core and 2 outer
- Panel 6 - Cut 2 core and 2 outer
