## Designer Notes {#notes}

I don't think I have ever had a design where I knew what I was going to name
it long before sitting down to actually create it.
Charlie Chinos was just too good to not make happen.

It took a while because it took a long time before [Titan](https://freesewing.org//designs/titan) was in a state where I was happy with it.
Trousers are hard. Trouser blocks double so.

This is for the most part a rather straight-forward chino pattern, but it has
one twist: The front packets are placed on the side seam. That side seam wraps
around towards the front to give the slanted pocket look.

It's a bit of unusual and creative design that I guess I did because I can?
Anyway, it's something to be mindful of because if you do not expect it the
front panels look a bit weird.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Charlie, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.5 meters (1.7 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](#fabric))
- About 30 centimeters (12 inches) of lining fabric (used for pocket bags)
- Fusible interfacing for the back pockets
- A zipper and button for the fly

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

The obvious choice for Charlie chinos, is [chino fabric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino_cloth), which is a cotton twill fabric.
These days it's often sold as a blend to a little bit of stretch, which is optional.

But you have a lot of options here, and your choice of fabric will influence what sort of style these project.

Go for **wool** for the most classic look. Check the suiting section of your fabric store for options.
If this is your first pair, some wool-poly blend is most likely going to be more budget-friendly.
But don't let price alone guide you, buying some cheap whimsical fabric is the best way to come up with a shitty looking pair of trousers, and get frustrated in the process.

For **cotton**, go for a heavier weight. Cotton might also be a bit easier on the beginner than wool.
If unsure what to use, ask for chino in the fabric store and simply pick a colour you like.

Nothing beats **linen** on a hot summer day.
It's fun to work with too, but it does wrinkle like a mofo, and even the most neatly made trousers look somewhat messy when made in linen.
What I'm saying is, maybe not for your first pair.
