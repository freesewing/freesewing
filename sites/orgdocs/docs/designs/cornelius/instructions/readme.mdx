### Step 1: The Front Pockets

- Press under the seam allowances of the non-notched edges of the pocket facings.
- Matching notches, pin the wrong sides of pocket facings to right side of pocket bags, _Edgestitch_ the folded edges to the pocket bags.
- _Baste_ the seam allowances of the notched edges of the pocket facings to the pocket bags.
- With right sides together, matching both notches, sew the pocket bags to the front and then press to the wrong side.
- Fold the pockets in half along the fold line, right sides together. Stitch the bottom of the pocket bag together.
- Alternatively you can _French Seam_ the bottom seams of the pocket bags together if you prefer.
- _Baste_ the top and side of the pocket bags to the front seam allowances matching notches.

:::note
Going forward the pockets and fronts will just be referred to as the fronts.

### Step 2: The Fly

- With right sides together, from the top _Baste_ along the fly line stopping at the notch on the crotch seam.
- From where you left off with basting, stitch the crotch seam together making sure to secure your stitches where the basting ends.
- Press open the fly and seam.
- Lay the fronts down wrong side up so the right sides of the fly flaps are facing you.
- Lay zipper face up on the front flaps, with the left side of the zipper touching the seam, with the bottom of the right zipper tape on the curved flap.
- Sew the right zipper tape to the right flap close to the zipper teeth using a zipper foot. Don't sew it to the front itself!
- Pull the zipper to the left so the right flap is pulled over.
- Pin the left zipper tape to the left flap.
- Sew the left zipper tape to left flap close to the zipper teeth using a zipper foot. Don't sew it to the front itself!
- Fold the zipper guard in half wrong sides together.
- Lay the zipper guard on the right flap, right sides touching.
- Sew the zipper guard to the right flap, _Finish_ the right side to your liking.
- _Finish_ the left side of the left flap to your liking.
- Unpick the basted part of the front seam.
- _Topstitch_ the right flap down, away from the now unpicked seam, as far down as you can.
- Pin/_Baste_ the zipper protector over to the right side to keep it out of the way for the next step
- On the outside side, sew the left flap down to the left, following the curved line.
- On the outside side, _Bar-Tack_ where you like them for reinforcement.

:::tip
When sewing the left flap down on the outside, you may find it best to make a template to help you.
:::

:::note
If you wish to orientate the fly the other way change the left to right and right to left in the steps above.  
If wanting something more historical than omit the zipper and make a buttonhole fly instead.
:::

### Step 3: Attaching the front to the back

- With right sides together sew the back pieces together along the back seam.
- With right sides together sew the front and back together at the side seams and inner leg seam. Making sure to leave a gap below the notches at the bottom of the side seams. The gap will be referred to as the list when going forward.

### Step 4: Leg bands

Use the method of the cuff style you chose as they are different depending on which style you are using.

#### Traditional and Elegant

- _Finish_ the raw edges of the slits.
- Press the seam allowances of the slits to the wrongs sides. Stitch in place.
- Sew one of the leg band pieces to each leg right sides together, matching notches.
- Press the bands and seam allowance down and away from leg. Trim the seam allowance to reduce bulk.
- Press the top seam allowance to the wrong side of the remaining leg band pieces. Trim the top seam allowance.
- With right sides together sew the remaining leg and pieces to the attached leg bands along the bottoms and sides.
- Turn the leg bands out. Press.
- _Slipstitch_ or _Whipstitch_ the folded edge of the waistband to front, making sure the folded edge is covering the stitching.
- Sew the buttonhole. The buttons will be sewn later.

:::note
If you are worried about a draft you can create a triangle piece of fabric that sits behind the slits out of your pocket fabric. Attaching it before Step 3 to one of the sides of the slits.
:::

#### Keystone

- If using construct plackets for the leg slits.
- Sew the plackets to the leg slits similar to how you would sew a sleeve cuff on a shirt.
- Close the darts on the leg band pieces.
- Sew one of the leg band pieces to each leg right sides together, matching notches.
- Press the bands and seam allowance down and away from leg. Trim the seam allowance to reduce bulk.
- Press the top seam allowance to the wrong side of the remaining leg band pieces. Trim the top seam allowance.
- With right sides together sew the remaining leg and pieces to the attached leg bands along the bottoms and sides.
- Turn the leg bands out. Press.
- _Slipstitch_ or _Whipstitch_ the folded edge of the waistband to front, making sure the folded edge is covering the stitching.
- Sew the buttonhole. The buttons will be sewn later.

:::note
If you are worried about a draft you will need to construct plackets for the leg slits.
:::

:::note
**For both Keystone, Traditional and Elegant Styles**

You can _Edgestitch_ the leg bands together like a modern waistband if you prefer.
:::

### Step 5: Waistband

- Face one of the waistband pieces using your preferred method.
- Sew the faced waistband piece to the top of the legs right sides together.
- Press the waistband and seam allowance up and away from leg. Trim the seam allowance to reduce bulk.
- Press the bottom seam allowance to the wrong side of the remaining waistband piece. Trim the bottom seam allowance.
- With right sides together sew the remaining waistband to the faced waistband along the top and sides.
- Turn the waistband out. Press.
- _Slipstitch_ or _Whipstitch_ the folded edge of the waistband to front, making sure the folded edge is covering the stitching.
- Sew the buttonhole. The buttons will be sewn later.

:::note

### Step 6: Buttons

- Sew the waistband and leg band buttons on.

### Step 7: Enjoy!

You're all done! Now go have a ride in your brilliant new cycling breeches!

## Step 1: Close seams

![Close the side and shoulder seams](step01.png)

Put front and back on top of each other with _good sides together_.
Sew the side seams and the short seams at the shoulder straps. If you have a serger, this is a good moment to use it. If not, finish your seams otherwise.

## Step 2: Finish hem

![Finish the hem](step02.png)

Fold the hem upwards, and sew it down. If you have a coverlock, use it. If not, use a _twin needle_ or _zig-zag stitch_ to keep the seam stretchable.

:::note

##### Fold only once, to avoid bulk

Knitwear doesn't ravel, so you can simply fold this over once and sew it down, then neatly trim back the fabric.

:::

## Step 3: Sew knit binding to the front

:::note

##### About knit binding

If you are new to [knit binding](/docs/sewing/knit-binding), you might read [this page on the subject](/docs/sewing/knit-binding).

###### Repeat steps 3 and 4 for both armholes and the neck opening

The procedure outlined below applies to both of the armholes as well as the neck opening. In other words, you'll have to do this three times.

###### Start with the simplest opening

I would advise you to start with whatever opening has the most uniform curvature. By default, those are the arm holes, but if you changed the pattern options (think racerback) that might not be the case.

Either way, the less sharp bends you have, the easier it will be. So start with that to warm up before you do the trickier bends.

:::

We are going to finish the arm and neck hole with [knit binding](/docs/sewing/knit-binding)
(note: not a knit band. There's a difference, and it's explained [here](/docs/sewing/knit-binding)).

:::note

This is the only part of making this A-shirt that requires a bit of practice. Don't worry, all you need to do is make a couple of these and you'll be a pro in no time.

:::

### Pick your spot

![Applying knit binding](step03a.png)

The first thing we need to do is decide where we are going to start/stop our binding. Here's what I suggest:

- For the armholes: at the side seam. This will hide our seam under the arm
- For the neck opening: the center back of the neck. You might want to mark this with a pin

### Place (the start of) your binding

![Place (the start of) your binding](step03b.png)

Put your A-shirt down with the good side up, and place your binding strip on top of it with the good side down (as in, good sides together).

Align the long edge of your strip with the edge of your fabric so the strip lies on top of the fabric (not in the opening). Place the corner on your starting point.

Now shift your binding strip 1cm beyond your starting point. This little extra will guarantee we can join the two ends later.

### Make sure you know where to sew

![Make sure you know where to sew](step03c.png)

We are going to sew 1.5cm from the edge. So be careful because this is not the standard seam allowance.

:::tip

The easy way to keep this 1.5cm distance is by using a seam gauge.
Or do what I do, place a piece of marking tape on your sewing machine and mark a line on it 1.5cm from your needle.
Then all you need to do is keep the edge of your fabric aligned with that line.

:::

Also, we are not starting at our start point, but we skip the first 3cm. We'll need this wiggle room later to join the ends of our binding.

### Sew binding in place

![Sew binding in place](step03d.png)

Sew your binding in place while gently stretching the binding, but not the fabric. Make sure not to sew the last 3cm but leave them, just as you did at the start.

You might need to practice a bit to get the hang of it.

> Make sure to stretch your binding more when you're taking a sharper bend.
> Read my notes on [knit binding](/docs/sewing/knit-binding) for more info.

### Mark binding ends

![Joining the binding ends](step03e.png)

With about 6cm left to go before we complete our circle, it's time to sew the ends of the binding together.

![Mark binding ends](step03f.png)

Take one of the edges, and stretch it along the 3cm separating it from the start point as you would while sewing.

Mark the binding where it reaches the start point. Do the same for the other end.

### Sew binding ends together

![Join the ends of the binding](step03g.png)

Fold your A-shirt in whatever way makes it easier for you to place both binding ends with good sides together, aligning the marks. Sew them together on the mark.

> 6 cm is not much, but should be enough to get both edges comfortably under your sewing machine to sew them together.

### Finish last 6cm of binding

![Sew binding ends together](step03h.png)

Now that your binding ends are joined together, it's time to finish the last 6cm of binding. Sew it down, staying 1.5cm from the edge as you did before.

## Step 4: Fold knit binding to the back and sew down

### Fold your binding over the fabric edge to the back

![Fold knit binding to the back](step04a.png)

Fold your binding fabric around the fabric of your A-shirt to the back. This is how we'll sew it down.

> While the fabric is folded double at the front (hiding the fabric edge in the process) there's no need for that at the back. We will merely trim back the edge later, given that knit doesn't ravel. If we were to fold back the fabric at the back too, it would only add bulk.

### Sew your binding down

![Sew the knit binding down](step04b.png)

From the right side of your fabric, sew along the inner edge of your binding (furthest from the edge), making sure to catch the binding at the back in the process.

:::note

If you have a coverlock machine, that would be perfect for this seam

:::

You'll have to, once again, stretch your binding a bit while doing this. But this time, there's an extra caveat to look out for.

:::note

##### Beware of the uneven feed

As you feed your binding through your sewing machine, the feed dogs will pull the bottom layer (back of your binding) forward.

In a perfect world, all layers will follow smoothly.
But more often than not, the top layer (front of your binding) tends to lag behind a bit.
This causes your binding to not neatly fold around the edge of the fabric, but make ugly wrinkles.

So watch out for this, and if you see it happening, stretch the under-layer a bit extra to compensate.

:::

## Step 5: Trim back knit binding on the inside

![Trim back knit binding on the inside](step05.png)

On the inside of your A-shirt, trim back the knit binding against your seam to finish up.

:::note

Be careful not to cut a hole in your A-shirt. Seriously, this happened to me on more than one occasion.
