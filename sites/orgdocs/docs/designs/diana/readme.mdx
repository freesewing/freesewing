## Designer Notes {#notes}

This project started because one day I wanted to sew a sleeveless draped top
with some leftover fabric I had after making another dress. I used a basic body
block from Freesewing, and manually modified the pattern to create a draped
neckline. Since I was pretty happy with the result, and the modifications were
simple, I decided to create a Freesewing pattern for it, so it could be
available for other people.

The original top I made had two layers, a nice viscose with a beautiful flower
pattern that acted as a lining, and a sheer chiffon on top that let the viscose
show through. The nice thing about adding a lining is that you can see it in
the drape, which gives a beautiful effect!

No interesting story about the name, just the first name that came to my mind
that started with the letter D of draped :)

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Diana, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1.5 meters (1.7 yards) (or half of that if it's wide enough to fit the sleeves next to the body) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](#fabric))

:::note

#### A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life easier.

If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it.
Because these side seams and shoulder seams won't get stretched out, you can just sew them with a regular straight stitch.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

This top works best in one of these two scenarios:

- Use a stretch fabric, and choose minimal ease
- Or use a non-stretch fabric with good _drape_, in which case you'll want to add more ease. Flowy fabrics can be cut on the bias for a body-hugging effect

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut **1 back** on the fold
- Cut **1 front** on the fold
- Cut **2 sleeves** with _good sides together_
