## Designer Notes {#notes}

This is a collaboration between Stoffsuchti and me. She designed the bag and
needed someone to turn it into code for FreeSewing. I happily obliged, and this
is the result.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Hortensia, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 - 2 metres (0.6 - 2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))
- About 0.5 - 2 metres (0.6 - 2.2 yards) of lining fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))
- A zipper the length of the zipper panels and matching the [coil
  width](/docs/designs/hortensia/options/zippersize/) selected
- (Optional) About 1 - 2 metres (1.1 - 2.2 yards) of bias binding if you want
  to bind the side panel edges on the outside.
- (Optional) Bag strap webbing double the length of the strap part with seam
  allowance and similar width if you don't wish to make your own straps
- (Optional) Interfacing if needed to strengthen fabric and/or for the strap

:::tip
The amount of fabric you need depends on [Hortensia's size
option](/docs/designs/hortensia/options#size). If you are uncertain of how much
you need turn on paperless mode whilst viewing the pattern and add the bottom
measures of Part 1 SidePanel, Part 2 FrontBackPanel and Part 3 BottomPanel to
give yourself a rough estimate.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

The key fabric choices for Hortensia are non-stretch, durable and strong enough
to hold items.

Your main fabric choice ultimately comes down to your personal style and what
you wish to use your handbag for. Due to Hortensia having a size option it can
also be enlarged and used for things such as a gym bag which does not need to
be as fancy as an upmarket handbag. So you may just simply want to go with
**Cottons**, **Linens** or have a little fun with **Printed Cottons**. If you
want something more fancy you can try going for **Brocades** and other luxe
fabrics. If you want something that will be very durable you can try
**Upholstery fabrics**. You can also try **Leather** but this will be harder to
sew especially if it is thick so only use it if you know what you are doing.
Remember if you wish to use it all the time, favour practicality over design,
as the goal should be to make it last rather than make it fancy. If you do not
care about the look at all then this may be an opportunity to use up fabric
from your stash that you otherwise would not such as that ugly fabric you can
never find a use for.

:::tip
If you find that the fabric you want to use is a bit too thin or flimsy you can
interface the pieces to give then strength.

### Lining Fabric

On the flipside the lining does not need to be as strong and simply needs to
cover the raw seams and protect the outer fabric. If you want something fancy
you can go for **Silks** and **Satins** but **Cotton** linings will do just as
well. Bear in mind what you intend to store in the bag. If you intend to carry
a lot you should go for something less prone to tearing, if you are only using
it for knick-knacks and small personal items you can get away with fancier
fabrics such as silks. The lining is also an opportunity to use up any fabrics
in your stash that you don't like or don't have a use for as it will be hidden
in the final product and only you will know/see.
