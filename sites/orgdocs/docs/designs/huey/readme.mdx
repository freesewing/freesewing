## Designer Notes {#notes}

I had a hoodie I liked, but after years of wear it sort of disintegrated. So I
reincarnated it in this design and now its spirit can live on forever.

The name choice is a tip of the hat to [Huey P.
Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_P._Newton).

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Huey, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 2 metres (2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))
- Ribbing fabric for the hem and cuffs.
- 1 open ended zipper the length of front seam including hood and waistband.
- (Optional) Cording or suitable alternate for hood strings.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

You may find a dedicated sweatshirt/tracksuit fabric section in your fabric
store of choice. If you don't, just head for the knitwear section and look for
a thicker comfortable knit fabric.

As far as fibers go, you can go all cotton, or opt for a poly or acryl cotton
blend.

Make sure to pay attention to the inside of the fabric. Sweatshirt fabrics come
in loopback and brushed back. If you want that OMG-it-feels-so-soft-on-my-skin
feeling, go for brushed.

:::tip
You don't have to use sweatshirt fabric. Other options are available, from
fashion-forward neoprene (aka scuba) to a more eyebrow-rising choice like
crushed velour (aka velvet).

Or if you have given up on class, you could go for fleece.
