![Collar ease](collarease.svg)

Controls the amount of ease at your collar/neck and the size
of the neck opening..

Hugo uses the neck circumference measurement rather than head
circumference to produce the neck opening size when generating patterns.
Use this option to adjust the neck opening size if needed.
