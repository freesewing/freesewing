## Designer Notes {#notes}

I wanted to try my hand on raglan sleeves, so this is what I ended up with.
It's a hooded sweater, with raglan sleeves, and an optional kangaroo pocket.

I named it `hugo` in memory of Hugo De Cock, my godfather with a name to make
pornstars jealous.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Hugo, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 2 meters (2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- Ribbing fabric for the hem and cuffs

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

You may find a dedicated sweatshirt/tracksuit fabric section in your fabric
store of choice. If you don't, just head for the knitwear section and look for
a thicker comfortable knit fabric.

As far as fibers go, you can go all cotton, or opt for a poly or acryl cotton
blend.

Make sure to pay attention to the inside of the fabric. Sweatshirt fabrics come
in loopback and brushed back. If you want that OMG-it-feels-so-soft-on-my-skin
feeling, go for brushed.

:::tip
You don't have to use sweatshirt fabric. Other options are available, from
fashion-forward neoprene (aka scuba) to a more eyebrow-rising choice like
crushed velour (aka velvet).

Or if you have given up on class, you could go for fleece.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- **Main fabric**
  - Cut **1 front** on the fold
  - Cut **1 back** on the fold
  - Cut **2 sleeves**, good sides together
  - Cut **1 pocket** on the fold
  - Cut **2 pocket facing(s)**, good sides together
  - Cut **4 Hood side(s)**, 2x2 good sides together
  - Cut **2 hood center(s)**, good sides together
  - Cut **1 neck binding**
- **Ribbing**
  - Cut **2 cuff(s)**
  - Cut **1 waistband**

:::warning Caveats

- **sleeve**: There's a single notch at the front, and a double notch at the
  back. These notches match on the front and back parts respectively.
- **pocket facing** and **hood**: Watch out for the grainlines on these parts

Because Hugo's raglan sleeve also covers a portion of the back and front, the
sleeve is the dominant feature of your draft.
