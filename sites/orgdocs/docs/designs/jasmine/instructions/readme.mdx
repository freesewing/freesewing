## Optional: Pockets

#### Kangaroo Pocket

Zig-zag stitch, overlock, or serge the edges of the pocket piece if it's made from a fabric that will
unravel.

Fold the seam allowance to the wrong side all the way around the pocket and press.

Edge-stitch the two upper edges of the pocket, the ones that will be the pocket openings later.

Position the pocket on the back of the jacket. You can either line it up with the markings on the
pattern or eyeball it, exact alignment doesn't really matter.

Edge-stitch along the top side of the pocket, then the three bottom sides, to firmly attach the pocket
to the back while leaving the two upper edges open.

## Optional: Merge the body pieces

#### Single piece

If you've cut your body piece out of a single layer of a non-unraveling fabric like knit or fleece,
you're done! No finishing of the edges is necessary. Move onto closures, but you can follow the bias
tape instructions anyway if you like.

#### Stitch and turn

If you've cut two layers with seam allowance, lay them on top of each other with right sides facing.

Sew most of the way around, leaving a gap at the back about 50% wider than your palm to turn
the coat out through.

If you've picked a fabric with some stretch, use a zigzag stitch or a whip stitch. For no stretch,
use a straight stitch or backstitch. Back tack or tie off the edges of the gap at the back.

Trim the seam allowance and clip the curves, and turn the coat back out through the opening you left.

Tuck the seam allowance in between the layers at the back opening, and slip stitch the opening closed
by hand.

You can press the edges flat now if you like, or even edgestitch around the whole jacket to keep the
edges flatter and neater.

And you're done. Move on to closures.

#### Bias Tape

If you're merging two layers with bias tape, put them together with the wrong sides facing (right sides
out!) and baste along the edges to keep them in place while you apply the tape.

Apply bias tape around the edges, stitch it in place, and you're done.

## Closures

#### Velcro (aka hook and loop fasteners)

Pick which side of the neck opening you would like to be on top when the jacket is closed.
Apply one side of your velcro to the bottom of this end, and the other side to
the top of the other end.

Repeat the same process with the closures at the belly.

Rectangles are drawn out on the pattern to indicate the placement, but it's fine if your
velcro is a little wider or narrower. You can cut it to size, use multiple pieces,
or leave it be.
