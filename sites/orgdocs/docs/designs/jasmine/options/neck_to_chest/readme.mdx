title: Neck to Chest
---

This should be measured vertically down the dog's spine, from the back of the collar to the point
where you took the chest measurement. It's used to place the back of the armhole, so make
sure the point where you're taking the chest measurement is far back enough to allow free range
of motion around the elbows.

If you aren't sure where to measure it, leave it at 100%. The default scaling is pretty generous
and will place it well enough for most dogs.
