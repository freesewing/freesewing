This is a garment made from a stretch fabric. So use appropriate seam
solutions. A serger is a good way to do this, as are specific stitches that
certain sewing machine provide. A zigzag stitch will do if that's all you have.

Keep in mind that since these seams are always under tension, it may be a good
idea to double them up, or provide a zigzag in addition to serging the seam.

## Step 1: Construct the legs

- With _good sides together_ sew the crotch seam of the fronts together.
- With _good sides together_ sew the cross seam of the backs together.
- With _good sides together_ sew the front to the back along the inseam.
- With _good sides together_ sew the front to the back along the side seams.

sew the inseam and side seams.

## Step 2: The waistband

- With _good sides together_ sew the waistband together along the short edges
  creating a loop.
- Fold the waistband in half lengthwise _wrong sides together_.
- Pin the waistband to the legs _good sides together_ matching the seam of the
  waistband to the centre back seam of the legs.
- Sew the waistband to the legs.
- Press the waistband up and away from the legs.

## Step 3: Hemming

Hem the legs. It is recommended to two parallel lines of stitches to secure the
hems.

### Step 4: Enjoy!
