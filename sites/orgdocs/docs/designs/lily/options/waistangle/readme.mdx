title: 'Waistband angle'
---

Controls the angle of the waistband when the garment is viewed from the side.

Increasing this option will raise the back of the pants and lower the waistband in the front.
This is ideal for those with a curvy body who want the waistband to sit below the belly in the front, but above the butt in the back.

If you're setting the waistband angle to a larger value, it's also a good idea to increase the waist height to make sure you've got enough coverage in the front.
