## Designer Notes {#notes}

This is a 18th century pocket pattern based on the hanging pocket in Patterns
of Fashion 1 pp. 73. I made it so people could have a historical pocket pattern
that is easily adjustable.

I would like historical patterns and resources to be more accessible to people
so the documentation has some historical context and suggestions on
historically accurate ways to make it, but its just as awesome to see people
make wild modern versions.

:::tip Historical context

Tie-on pockets like Lucy were worn roughly from the mid-seventeenth (1650s)
century until the end of the 19th century (1890s). They came in all shapes and
sizes but Lucy is based on an 18th century example.

They were worn and used by all members of society and were mainly womens wear
as men had a variety of pockets sewn into their clothing.

Pockets would be tied around the waist and could be accessed through a slit in
skirts and petticoats. Where the pocket would be in between the layers was up
to the individual. If it was hidden in between layers that would provide more
security, but hinder accessibility. People who worked in trade often wore their
pockets on the outside of their garments entirely, for easy access.

(Tie-on) Pockets were used alongside patch pockets, sewn in pockets, bags and
other ways to carry your things. Sometimes they even had additional pockets
hidden inside them!

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Lucy, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric)
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of fabric if using a lining
- About 2 meters (2.2 yards) of bias binding or strips of fabric if binding the
  edges
- A length of tape that you can tie around your waist to make the ties with

Pockets like these do not need to be made out of whole pieces of fabric, you
can piece together scraps into a large enough piece to cut your pocket pattern
out of. Neither do both sides need to be made out of the same fabric.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Because pockets were worn by people in every layer of society historically what
they were made out of varied intensely. Some were made out of sturdy and plain
fabrics, marked with the owners initials. Others were made out of lavish silks
or richly embroidered.

As such when it comes to fabric options the world is your oyster.

- Modern prints make fun modern pockets
- Use a plain cotton or linen for a more historical option
- Have a lot of scraps? Make a patchwork pocket!
- Pockets were often a first embroidery project, so go wild if you want to

The one thing to keep in mind is how stable your fabric is. If it is not very
stable or you think it won’t hold very much weight, you can add a lining.

Additionally, if you are handsewing your pocket it is worth picking a fabric
that isn’t too thick or heavy.

Your binding doesn’t have to be the same colour as the main fabric either. You
can use it to add a fun accent, or make your pocket fancier. Bias binding
curves easier around any curves, but you can just as easily use strips of
fabric as a more waste conscious option.

The ties can be made from self fabric, or you can use something like a twill
tape instead.

As always, whether you want to stick to historical practices or make something
modern is entirely up to you!
