## Designer Notes {#notes}

I started working on this design when I wanted to make a pair of cycling
shorts. I had made a pair in the past, using a commercial pattern. And since
you can buy the chamois separately, this is a great garment to make.

After starting this, I realized that there would be people who would want a
more traditional leggings pattern. So I decided to make two patterns, one with
a seam on the inside of the leg (traditional), and one without a seam on the
inside (this one). I played with the idea to keep both patterns under one name,
but it became obvious that it would be better to have two different patterns
instead. Since this one was called `lumina`, I named the other `lumira`. As it
may be, I quickly got distracted by the other version, and that one was
published first.

Since this pattern has a panel on the side, it seemed easy to add a pocket
option. So if you want to keep your mobile phone on you while working out, this
is the pattern to use.

I was also in need of a pair of gym climbing pants. So this pattern has the
option to have a positive ease setting, allowing you to use a non-stretch knit
fabric. This makes for loose-fitting workout pants.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Lumina, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.5 metres (1.7 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- Elastic for the leg openings and waist.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

This pattern requires a stretch fabric. The stretch needs to be perpendicular
to the grainline. There is no stretch required along the grainline, but a 4-way
stretch fabric can definitely be used. Not all stretch fabrics have the same
amount of stretch. The default ease value of -5% works well for fabrics that
have 60% stretch. If your fabric has a different amount of stretch, you may
want to adjust this setting accordingly. Reduce the ease when your fabric has
more stretch. Getting the ease right is _very_ important for getting a good
fit.

:::tip
If the ease setting is larger than 0 (positive ease), any type of knit fabric
can be used. Keep in mind that even with the ease set at the maximum, you
probably will not be able to use a fabric with no stretch at all (a woven
fabric).
:::

These fabrics come in different weights. Pick one that works for how you intend
to use it. Thicker fabrics provide more support and warmth.

For yoga pants, take something that has a medium thickness. Supplex is a good
choice for this. It also works well for cycling. For other athletics use
fabrics that would be appropriate for that. Most fabrics that contain spandex
will work.

:::tip
Since this pattern has an outside panel, you can use contrasting fabrics to
make interesting effects.
