## Designer Notes {#notes}

I started working on this design when I wanted to make a pair of cycling shorts. I had made a pair in the past,
using a commercial pattern. And since you can buy the chamois separately, this is a great garment to make.

After starting this, I realized that there would be people who would want a more traditional leggings pattern.
So I decided to make two patterns, one with a seam on the inside of the leg (traditional), and one without a
seam on the inside (this one). I played with the idea to keep both patterns under one name, but it became
obvious that it would be better to have two different patterns instead. Since this one was called `lumina`, I
named the other `lumira`. As it may be, I quickly got distracted by the other version, and that one was
published first.

Since this pattern has a panel on the side, it seemed easy to add a pocket option. So if you want to keep
your mobile phone on you while working out, this is the pattern to use.

I was also in need of a pair of gym climbing pants. So this pattern has the option to have a positive ease
setting, allowing you to use a non-stretch knit fabric. This makes for loose-fitting workout pants.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Lumina, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.5 metres (1.7 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Lumina Fabric options](/docs/designs/lumina/fabric/))
- Elastic for the leg openings and waist.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

This pattern requires a stretch fabric. The stretch needs to be perpendicular to the grainline. There is no stretch required along
the grainline, but a 4-way stretch fabric can definitely be used. Not all stretch fabrics have the same amount of stretch. The default
ease value of -5% works well for fabrics that have 60% stretch. If your fabric has a different amount of stretch, you may want to
adjust this setting accordingly. Reduce the ease when your fabric has more stretch. Getting the ease right is _very_ important for
getting a good fit.

:::note
If the ease setting is larger than 0 (positive ease), any type of knit fabric can be used. Keep in mind that even with the ease
set at the maximum, you probably will not be able to use a fabric with no stretch at all (a woven fabric).
:::

These fabrics come in different weights. Pick one that works for how you intend to use it. Thicker fabrics provide more support
and warmth.

For yoga pants, take something that has a medium thickness. Supplex is a good choice for this. It also works well for cycling. For
other athletics use fabrics that would be appropriate for that. Most fabrics that contain spandex will work.

:::note
Since this pattern has an outside panel, you can use contrasting fabrics to make interesting effects.
