## Designer Notes {#notes}

I started working on this design when I decided I needed more leggings to cycle
in the fall and winter. My previous pair was made with a commercial pattern,
and they have served me well. The easy solution would have been to just make
some more. But if I need some of these, there should be more people that do.

I decided to make this pattern so it allows for a waistband to be part of it.
This should make for a good fit on a wide range of body types. It can
optionally create a gusset that is relatively large in the back. This is both a
nice design feature, and provides support for the rear. To exemplify this, you
could use a contrasting fabric for this part.

The pattern's gusset can be extended to the front to allow for a bulge. And
since I wanted this pattern to be able to be used for cycling, there is an
option to use a chamois, the padding you find in most cycling shorts.

This is a pattern that has no outside seams, so interesting designs on the
fabric will not be distorted.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Lumira, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.5 metres (1.7 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Lumira Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- Elastic for the leg openings and waist.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

This pattern requires a stretch fabric. The stretch needs to be perpendicular
to the grainline. There is no stretch required along the grainline, but a 4-way
stretch fabric can definitely be used. Not all stretch fabrics have the same
amount of stretch. The default ease value of -5% works well for fabrics that
have 60% stretch. If your fabric has a different amount of stretch, you may
want to adjust this setting accordingly. Reduce the ease when your fabric has
more stretch. Getting the ease right is _very_ important for getting a good
fit.

:::tip
If the ease setting is larger than 0 (positive ease), any type of knit fabric
can be used. Keep in mind that even with the ease set at the maximum, you
probably will not be able to use a fabric with no stretch at all (a woven
fabric).
:::

These fabrics come in different weights. Pick one that works for how you intend
to use it. Thicker fabrics provide more support and warmth.

For yoga pants, take something that has a medium thickness. Supplex is a good
choice for this. It also works well for cycling. For other athletics use
fabrics that would be appropriate for that. Most fabrics that contain spandex
will work.

:::tip
Since this pattern has an outside panel, you can use contrasting fabrics to
make interesting effects.
