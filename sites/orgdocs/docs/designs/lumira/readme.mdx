## Designer Notes {#notes}

I started working on this design when I decided I needed more leggings to cycle in the fall and winter. My previous
pair was made with a commercial pattern, and they have served me well. The easy solution would have been to just
make some more. But if I need some of these, there should be more people that do.

I decided to make this pattern so it allows for a waistband to be part of it. This should make for a good fit on
a wide range of body types. It can optionally create a gusset that is relatively large in the back. This is both
a nice design feature, and provides support for the rear. To exemplify this, you could use a contrasting fabric
for this part.

The pattern's gusset can be extended to the front to allow for a bulge. And since I wanted this pattern to be
able to be used for cycling, there is an option to use a chamois, the padding you find in most cycling shorts.

This is a pattern that has no outside seams, so interesting designs on the fabric will not be distorted.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Lumira, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.5 metres (1.7 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Lumira Fabric options](/docs/designs/lumira/fabric/))
- Elastic for the leg openings and waist.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

This pattern requires a stretch fabric. The stretch needs to be perpendicular to the grainline. There is no stretch required along
the grainline, but a 4-way stretch fabric can definitely be used. Not all stretch fabrics have the same amount of stretch. The default
ease value of -5% works well for fabrics that have 60% stretch. If your fabric has a different amount of stretch, you may want to
adjust this setting accordingly. Reduce the ease when your fabric has more stretch. Getting the ease right is _very_ important for
getting a good fit.

:::note
If the ease setting is larger than 0 (positive ease), any type of knit fabric can be used. Keep in mind that even with the ease
set at the maximum, you probably will not be able to use a fabric with no stretch at all (a woven fabric).

These fabrics come in different weights. Pick one that works for how you intend to use it. Thicker fabrics provide more support
and warmth.

For yoga pants, take something that has a medium thickness. Supplex is a good choice for this. It also works well for cycling. For
other athletics use fabrics that would be appropriate for that. Most fabrics that contain spandex will work.

:::note
Since this pattern has an outside panel, you can use contrasting fabrics to make interesting effects.
