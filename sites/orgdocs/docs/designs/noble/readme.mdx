:::warning Noble is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based. They are sometimes
also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are
different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other patterns.

## Designer Notes {#notes}

Noble is a design for a block with prince(ss) seams instead of darts. It is
based on `bella`.

This is not intended to be made as is, but merely to base other designs on.
This is also why I made it. I wanted to make a coat, and for it I needed a
block with prince(ss) seams. So I made that first, and the coat would come
later.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Noble, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 metres (0.6 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))

This list is for a default Noble Block. If you have/are making changes to the
block you may need to get additional items such as closures, binding etc.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

If you are making a default Noble to see how it fits we recommend a fabric such
as **Calico (Muslin)** or a cheaper fabric that matches the drape and stretch
of the fabric you intend to make a finalised version of Noble with.

You can use scraps of fabrics from your stash so don't worry about buying
fabric specifically for Noble.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

**Main fabric**

- Cut **1 Front Inside** part on the fold.
- Cut **2 Front Outside** parts.

### Shoulder dart

- Cut **2 Back Inside** parts.
- Cut **2 Back Outside** parts.

### Armhole dart

- Cut **2 Back** parts.

These cutting instructions are just for the default Noble block. Adjust your cutting accordingly if you have/are making changes to the block.

:::Tip
If you do not have someone to help pin you into Noble then you may find it
easier to Cut 2 Front Inside parts with seam allowance and sew the backs up
when constructing so you can pin in the front.
