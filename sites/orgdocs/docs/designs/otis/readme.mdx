## Designer Notes {#notes}

When my niece had a baby, I knew just what to do; sew her some clothes for the
little one. And I had never made any clothes for infants. What they should look
like was easy. I had kids of my own years ago, and the one-piece things should
be easy to make.

What I did not have was a pattern. That meant that I should get one, or make
one. That was not a hard decision; FreeSewing was definitely lacking in the
infant-focused designs. Infants have the nice quality that while they are
growing, they grow in each direction at the same pace. The only real challenge
is that their head is a lot bigger in proportion than older specimens. A normal
shirt with opening doesn't work. But there are easy solutions to that, and
these are used by all romper making manufacturers.

I incorporated the neck design with a simple body design, and a snap closure.
Easy short or long sleeves completed the design.

According to my niece, they fit fine!

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Otis, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric Options](#fabric))
- 3 snaps.
- A little bit of interfacing if your fabric is very stretchy.

:::tip
You can use a different color fabric for the bindings to give it some
additional flair.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

Rompers are normally made from knit fabric. For best results, use a cotton
fabric with just one or two percent of spandex. Jersey works well if it has
good recovery.

### Interfacing

If your fabric has a lot of stretch, it is probably a good idea to put some
iron-on interfacing on the snap placket.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

  - Cut **1 back** part on fold
