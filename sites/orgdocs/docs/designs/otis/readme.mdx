## Designer Notes {#notes}

When my niece had a baby, I knew just what to do; sew her some clothes for the little one. And I
had never made any clothes for infants. What they should look like was easy. I had kids of my own
years ago, and the one-piece things should be easy to make.

What I did not have was a pattern. That meant that I should get one, or make one. That was not a hard
decision; FreeSewing was definitely lacking in the infant-focused designs. Infants have the nice
quality that while they are growing, they grow in each direction at the same pace. The only real
challenge is that their head is a lot bigger in proportion than older specimens. A normal shirt
with opening doesn't work. But there are easy solutions to that, and these are used by all
romper making manufacturers.

I incorporated the neck design with a simple body design, and a snap closure. Easy short or
long sleeves completed the design.

According to my niece, they fit fine!

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Otis, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](/docs/designs/otis/fabric/))
- 3 snaps.
- A little bit of interfacing if your fabric is very stretchy.

:::note
You can use a different color fabric for the bindings to give it some additional flair.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

Rompers are normally made from knit fabric. For best results, use a cotton fabric with just one or two percent of spandex.
Jersey works well if it has good recovery.

### Interfacing

If your fabric has a lot of stretch, it is probably a good idea to put some iron-on interfacing on the snap placket.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- **Main fabric**
  - Cut **1 back** part on fold
  - Cut **1 front** part on fold

:::note
