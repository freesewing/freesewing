## Designer Notes {#notes}

Penelope is the first garment I made for someone else. I just met my partner
after figuring out that I like to sew. So obviously I wanted to sew something
for her. A pencil skirt seemed like the appropriate thing to do. I found a
drafting method online and made her a skirt. This fitted remarkably well.

So when it was time for me to try making another pattern for FreeSewing, this
was the obvious choice. I used the same basis for the drafting, but changed
everything to percentages, so it would scale from dolls to giants.

The design should not pose any issues for a sewist, although the hidden zipper
may be a challenge, specially if you line the skirt (which I would recommend).

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Penelope, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable main fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))
- An invisible or regular closed end zipper
- Some interfacing for the waistband (if using) and maybe for the vent and hem
- Some sort of closure for the waistband (if using)
- (Optional) About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of suitable lining fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

A pencil skirt is a rather formal cut, and most commonly is made in a suiting
material. In other words, a **fine wool**. More casual options among **medium
weight** fabrics include **cotton** or **denim**.

Using a fabric with some stretch will make it easier to get a comfortable fit
and give you some more room to move about as pencil skirts fit rather tight.
**Scuba** is often seen in pencil skirts as it is firm, has body but also
stretches.

### Lining Fabric

The lining fabric needs to be light, and allow the body to slide over it
easily. You also don't want something to thick as this will be constricting.
**Silky** fabrics are the go to choice as they are lightweight and slippery.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

:::note
The number of back parts depends on whether you want a vent, or have moved the
zipper to the back seam. Either one of these options will require you to cut
out two individual back parts. Otherwise the back is cut on the fold.

Due to this, the cutting list does not specify how many back parts to cut as
the pattern options determine this.
:::

**Main Fabric**

- Cut **1 front** part on fold.
- Cut **back** part(s).
- (Optional) Cut **1 waistband** parts on the fold.

**Lining Fabric (Optional)**

- Cut **1 front** part on fold.
- Cut **back** part(s).

:::tip
[See Penelope Instructions](/docs/designs/penelope/instructions/#lining) to
understand alterations to the front and back parts required for the lining.
:::

**Interfacing**

- Cut **1 waistband** part on the fold.

:::tip
When you cut out a piece on the fold, remember that the fold does not need to
be in the middle of the fabric. Choosing the placement of your pieces wisely
can greatly reduce the amount of fabric you need for your skirt.
