These instructions could need some drawings and more detailed instructions.
I'd be grateful if you improve them by clicking the link at the bottom on this page.

That said, Sabrina is very straightforward if you already made some similar designs.

If you want to follow a visual guide, [this awesome YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0vkrKxWZk)
by Kim Dave follows a very similar design and was used as inspiration.

The main difference between Sabrina and her design is
that we're using additional side pieces to better match the shape of the body.
:::

## Step 1: Create two bodies

- Sew both sides to the fronts, matching the notches, good sides together.

- Sew the back to both sides, matching the notches, good sides together.

- Join both shoulders, good sides together.

Do this twice to create one outer layer and one lining layer.

Optionally topstitch the seam allowances towards the back so they lay more flat.

## Step 2: Join the bodies

- Turn the outer body good-side-out and insert the lining body (bad side out) so the seams and bad sides are hidden between both layers.

- Match up all the seams and raw edges and clip them together.
  You probably don't want to use pins, as they can create permanent holes.

## Step 3: Finish the neck and armpits

:::tip
If you want to add some padding to the bra,
you can trim some fabric from the front armholes of the lining piece and leave that unattached when
attaching the binding.
This way you're creating a hole which can be used to insert padding.
You can also topstitch some lines onto the body to help with positioning the padding.
:::

Finish the neck and armholes using [knit binding](/docs/designs/aaron/instructions/#step-3-sew-knit-binding-to-the-front).

For this, cut 3 strips of your main fabric that are about 4 cm wide.

First, match up both raw edges of the neck opening of your body with the raw edge of one of your strips.

Serge all three layers together without using the knife, keeping some fabric in the back of the neck unattached.

Join the binding on the back of the neck and join the remaining binding to the body.

Fold the fabric to the bad side and topstitch to secure the fold.
Make sure to use a stretch stitch or cover stitch for the top-stitching.

Repeat this for the armholes.

Or use another method to finish the raw edges, like sewing on store-bough fold-over-elastic.

Whatever you do, make sure to stretch the binding you're attaching to the main body,
so that the openings are pulled together and don't stick up.

## Step 4: Attach the waistband

- Join the short sides of the waistband, good sides together, to create a loop.

- Fold it in half along the long side, so the bad sides are together and hidden.

- Place and clip the raw edge of the loop onto the bottom raw edge, outside the bra body.
  The seam of the waistband should be in the center back.

- Serge through all four layers on the bottom of the body. Make sure to not skip a layer. Leave around 5 cm (2 in) open on the back center.

- Cut some length of elastic to a size that feels good (is still comfortable while giving enough support) when you put it around your under bust line / waist.
  Include two seam allowances in that length.
  The length should be a bit shorter than the waistband rectangle you've cut previously.
  **Don't** join the elastic band into a loop yet.

- Attach a safety pin to one end of the band and feed it through the waistband.

- Once you've made sure that the elastic sits straight inside the waistband (and you haven't accidentally turned it), join both exposed ends of the elastic with your serger.

- Stretch the waistband to pull the elastic completely inside the waistband and sew the remaining length on the back close.

- Fold the waistband down and the seam allowance up.

- Optional: Topstitch the seam allowance with a stretch- or cover-stitch to secure it in that upwards direction.

- Optional: Topstitch onto the waistband to prevent it from moving or rotating inside the tunnel later.
