title: 'Armpit adjustment'

This option adjust the height of the armpit.

By default, a light negative ease is added, so it sits relatively snug in the armpit. But of course the fabric is stretchy and will not sit exactly like the measurements.

In my prototypes, the default value fits quite well without digging in, but you may find that you need to adjust this, especially if your waist-to-armpit measurement is dubious.
