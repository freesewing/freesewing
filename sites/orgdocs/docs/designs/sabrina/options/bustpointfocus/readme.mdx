title: 'Bust point focus'

This option determines how much the front side seam aims at the bust point (your nipple).

A value of 100% puts the seam directly onto the nipple, which results in an optimal bust shape and more even stretching, but can be uncomfortable.

Negative values shift the seam away from your nipple.

Leave this at the default value if in doubt.
