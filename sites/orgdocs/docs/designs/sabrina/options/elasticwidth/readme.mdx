Set this to the width of the elastic band you'll be using for your under bust band (waistband).

The default is set to 20 mm, which is a common value for store-bought elastics. Change according to what you've bought.

I don't recommend going below 10 mm, as this will either not give enough support or dig in uncomfortably.
