## Designer Notes {#notes}

Version 3 of FreeSewing needed something special. We've had the Skully logo on
all sorts of goodies. From measuring tapes to buttons, to cards. And Skully is
all over the web site.

But they are just a logo. There is no Skully you can pick up and hold. That is,
until now.

I wanted to make a Skully in 3D and give it to Joost for all of his work on the
new site. And I couldn't do that without making a sewing pattern for it too.
So this was the goal.

I bought a plastic skull, a skull plushy (which I hated once I started looking
at it more), and found a pattern for a skull. And I didn't like that pattern
either.

So what I ended up doing was taking paper, cutting it into pieces that were
taped onto the plastic skull, and manipulated with darts and seams until I had
something that looked somewhat like a skull. And with enough tweaking, I ended
up with something that can be stuffed and maintain a shape that is a reasonable
representation of Skully in 3D.

The first real version that was not made for testing got decorated with hair,
and together with a large needle was send to Belgium. After sitting at a
Belgium customs office for 4 weeks, and some phone calls from me, urging them
that it was not a thread to national security, it was delivered to Joost.

And now you too can make a Skully.

Wouter.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Skully, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.5 meters (0.6 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))
- Stuffing
- Embroidery floss for the hair
- Appropriately sized upholstery needle

:::note
This list is based on a default Skully and you may need less or more fabric
dependant on the [size you are making
Skully](/docs/designs/skully/options/size/).

For instance a 300% Skully will need 1.5 meters (0.5 meter x 300% = 1.5 meters)
and a 50% skully will need 0.25 meters (0.5 meter x 50% = 0.25 meters).

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

This plush toy is best made from a felt type of fabric. This will provide extra
rigidity to keep the shape correct, while still allowing it to be a plush toy.
Thin and stretchy fabrics are not well suited, because the shape will change
considerably due to tensions from the stuffing.

### Hair

Skully needs hair. Embroidery floss works very well, and can be had in all
colors.

### Stuffing

Since this is a plush toy, it will need to be stuffed with material. Most of
the time you'll want to use polyester fiberfill (polyfill), but if you have a
lot of fabric scraps, you can use shredded scrap fabric. However this may be
heavier and less soft than fiberfill. It's also worth thinking about whether
your Hi may be at risk of getting dirty, or want to go for a swim, as not all
stuffing options are washable.

### Needle

Skully has traded his sword for a needle. A needle this size is mostly sold as
upholstery needles. This will come in handy when doing some of the touch-ups at
the end of the construction.
