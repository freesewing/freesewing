## Designer Notes {#notes}

Tiberius was the first of the bunch, and also the simplest: a simple, nice
_tunica_, inspired by the ones worn by Romans in the late republic, early
empire (I can tell you that I read quite a lot of references and looked at
pictures of statues and reliefs to figure out the "how long should it be?"
question). This was a garment I wanted to make as part of a costume for my
TTRPG (table-top roleplaying game) character, who is kind of a fantasy Roman.

While writing down my measurements to make the _tunica_, I realised that this
was such a simple parametric design that it could be a way for me to dip my
toes into the coding part of Freesewing. And so I did. Even though it's "only"
a rectangle, I tried to put some things into it behind the scenes (seams?),
some failchecks to ensure that it results in a wearable garment. Since it's
only a rectangle, there is not much wriggle room (pun intended) for fit, making
it nice and easy but also challenging when you want to achieve a certain look
(the length of the apparent "sleeves", for example).

One slightly hidden feature is the possibility to add positional markers for
_clavi_, strips of colour on the _tunica_ to denote rank and/or class. Quite
fascinating,

The name is taken from James T. Kirk, by the way, who luckily had parents who
seemingly liked some debatable Roman emperors.

Lunetius, Tiberius and Walburga really come as a set. Not only were they born
at the same time, they are designed to work together to form a full outfit. Not
that this means that they can't be made separately :wink:

Designer Notes](/docs/designs/walburga#notes).

:::note On Historical Accuracy

The further we go back in time, the less extant garments we have to base
research on. Often there may be scraps of fabric left behind by stroke of luck
but most of our information starts to come from (in archaeology) secondary
sources like written texts from contemporaries.

This is especially true for the Roman and Mediaeval eras, not to mention that a
lot of the available research is behind a paywall.

We can’t be 100 percent historically accurate, because we’re living in a
different time, and everything we use to sew is different now from before. Even
fabric is woven in a different way.

How ‘accurate’ you want to be is up to you, there is no wrong way to do this
and research is not required -- though it can be fun!

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Tiberius, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 2 meters (2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric options](#fabric))
- (a belt, for wearing it)

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Tiberius can be made out of almost any woven fabric. Historically "accurate"
would be linen, wool, and, to an extent, cotton. If you care about
authenticity, research this a bit. In any case, natural fibers without any
stretch are the way to go.

Depending on the social status you want to portray, choose coarser or finer
fabrics. Different colours are also possible.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

:::tip

##### Use the power of the _paperless_ option - do **not** print this pattern

Tiberius is just a big rectangle, so printing the pattern out is a bit of a
waste. Save a tree, toggle the
[paperless](/docs/about/site/draft/core-settings/paperless) option, and copy
the dimensions to your fabric, while respecting the grainline.

:::

Tiberius consists of only one part, the _tunica_, that will act as a pattern
for both front and back pieces.

- cut _2 tunicae_, _on the fold_

:::note Notes
You have two options here: Either you cut your tunica in two pieces as
described above, or you cut it in only one piece. Historically speaking, the
time period or location you're aiming for can make a difference (ancient Rome
vs. ancient Greece, for example). If you care about authenticity, I suggest
researching this a bit.
