:::Warning Titan is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based. They are sometimes
also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are
different things.

Blocks are typically not made as-is but rather serve as a basis for other
patterns.

## Designer Notes {#notes}

I am very happy Titan exists because making a trouser block that works for a
variety of bodies is no simple task.

I had started on this a couple of times on my own, but for various reasons was
never happy and abandoned the effort more than once.

But when I teamed up with Debra Bean, we were able to finally get the job done
and Titan is now FreeSewing's foundational trouser block.

I'd like to thank Deb for her patient collaboration and valuable input.
Without it, I might have never finished this task.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Titan, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.5 meters (1.7 yards) of suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric)

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

If you are making a default Titan to see how it fits we recommend a fabric such
as **Calico (Muslin)** or a cheaper fabric that matches the drape and stretch
of the fabric you intend to make a finalised version of Titan with.

You can use scraps of fabrics from your stash so don't worry about buying
fabric specifically for Titan.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

**Main fabric**

- Cut **2 front** parts with _good sides together_
- Cut **2 back** parts with _good sides together_

These cutting instructions are just for the default Titan block. Adjust your
cutting accordingly if you have/are making changes to the block.
