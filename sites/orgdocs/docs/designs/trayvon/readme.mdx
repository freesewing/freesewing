## Designer Notes {#notes}

There's about a million patterns for ties on the internet, so why make another
one, right?

Well, this started hen I wanted to make a tie but every pattern I found was
cutting corners. Specifically, they all put the seam between the back and the
font at the exact tip. Which, sure, is easier to make. But that's not how ties
are supposed to be made.

So, I designed this pattern so I could make ties that looks professional, and
not home-made.

I gave it the name `trayvon` in memory of [Trayvon
Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trayvon_Martin) and more generally to
honour the memory of all victims of brutality at the hands of people in a
position of authority.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Trayvon, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- Between 0.5 meters - 1.5 meters (0.6 - 1.7 yards) of a suitable fabric ([see
  Fabric options](#fabric)), depending on whether you're cutting on the bias,
  the grain, or the cross-grain.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Tie fabric

The ties you find in the store are typically made out of silk or some imitation
silk poly. So it will come as no surprise that those are good options.

In general, you want something with good drape so that your tie hangs nicely.
Cutting your tie on bias can help here too.

Personally, I like using different fabrics for ties. Things like denim or
corduroy make great ties, while being a bit different from the run-of-the-mill
store-bought tie.

Additionally, silk and silk imitation is slippery and tricky to work with. If
this your first tie, consider an alternative fabric that is more forgiving.

Just make sure you pick a fabric that does not stretch or lose its shape
easily. You want your tie to look sharp, not saggy.

### Tie lining

The lining of the tie is the bit that is used at the tip to cover up the back.
If you are not sure what I mean, look at the back of the tip of an existing
tie. See that rectangular patch of fabric you can see there? That is the tie
lining.

Your tie lining will add an extra fabric inside a part of your tie. So it is
important to avoid bulk. Go for something thin, even when using a thicker tie
fabric.

Make sure your lining drapes at least as good as your tie fabric, so that it
doesn't interfere with the drape of your tie.

When in doubt, go for imitation silk. Do make sure to pick something that is a
nice match, or contrast, with your tie fabric.

### Tie interfacing

Your tie interfacing is the skeleton of your tie. It is the part that sits in
the middle and that you will only see while constructing your tie.

Tie interfacing can be notoriously hard to get. The best tie interfacing is
soft, fuzzy woven lambswool, but I have yet to walk into a fabric store that
carries this.

While you can get by with an alternative, like some wool fabric, or flannel, I
typically re-use the interfacing from an old tie.

:::tip Recycle the interfacing
As long as you keep your tie away from scissors and bondage fanatics, your tie
interfacing will effortlessly outlast your tie. So look in your wardrobe (or
the charity shop/thrift store) for that old tie with the stain on it, and take
it apart to salvage the tie interfacing.

As long as the tie you want to make is not wider or longer than the one you are
recycling, you have your tie interfacing right there.

:::tip Choosing your tie grain

![One fabric, different grains, different ties. Don't worry about rules, make
what you like](tie-grain.png)

This pattern does not include a grain line. The grain line is typically printed
on the pattern to show you how to place your pattern on your fabric, relative
to the fabric's grain.

For a tie, how you do this is not so much a rule as it is a personal choice. As
such, there is no grain line printed on the pattern. You can do what you want.

That being said, a lot of ties are cut on bias, as this results in the best
drape. If you are unsure what to do, consider cutting your tie on bias.

If this all sounds very confusing, might I suggest reading the help page on
[Fabric grain](/docs/sewing/fabric-grain).
