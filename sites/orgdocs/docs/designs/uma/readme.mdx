## Designer Notes {#notes}

This design is inspired by an earlier design (Ursula) which was created by
my friend Natalia.

In the run-up to the v3 release, we discussed the migration of the various
designs, and it became clear that for reasons (gestures vaguely towards people
on the internet being rather unappreciative) the original designer was
reluctant to continue maintaining their design.

Since it's a rather nice design not to mention a popular one, we agreed that I
would reincarnate the pattern. While at it, I also made some changes that
people had been asking for, such as the bulge option to make it gender-neutral.

Long story short:

- Everything that is great about this design is thanks to Natalia.
- Everything that sucks about this design is on me.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Uma, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 0.7 meters (0.8 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric
  options](#fabric))
- About 3 meters (3.3 yards) of underwear elastic, such as picot elastic or
  fold over elastic

##### Binding methods may affect the seam allowance

If using fold over elastic (FOE) or doing knit binding, you may wish to trim
away the seam allowance at the legs and waist before cutting. If you keep the
seam allowance, the finished product will have a slightly higher waist and
slightly smaller leg openings.

##### A serger/overlock is nice, but optional

As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life
easier. If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need
it. You can just sew Uma with a zigzag stitch.

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

You need a fabric with plenty of horizontal and vertical stretch (sometimes
called “four-way stretch”) for this pattern. Preferably something that is
comfortable, soft, and breathable.

Recommended fabrics include stretch jerseys, stretch mesh, stretch knits, or
most fabrics with at least 5% spandex. For example, modal (rayon) jersey with
spandex.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

Uma typically consists of a front, a back, and a lined gusset.
In that constellation, this is the cut list:

- **Main fabric**
  - Part 1: Cut **1 front**
  - Part 2: Cut **1 back**
  - Part 3: Cut **2 gusset**

However, if you enable the **Bulge** option, the front and gusset will become 1
part. In this case, the cutlist looks like this:

- **Main fabric**
  - Part 1: Cut **1 front**
  - Part 2: Cut **1 back**

:::note Notes

- Uma is a great scrap buster. If you have fabric scraps from making a [Teagan
  t-shirt](https://freesewing.org//designs/teagan/) or anything from a jersey
  fabric that has good stretch, this is a good way to use those up.
- You can use the same fabric for the whole garment, including the gusset
  lining. Some people prefer to use a cotton jersey instead to line the gusset.
  If you want to do that, cut **1 gusset** from your main fabric and **1
  gusset** from your lining fabric.
