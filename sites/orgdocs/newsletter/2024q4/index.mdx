## 🕵️ Behind the Seams: Vili

We chatted with Vili to learn a little more about their background and journey
to becoming a FreeSewing contributor! Vili has consistently wowed us, both with
their enthusiasm for tackling bugs, typos, and dead links on FreeSewing, as
well as their dedication to a handmade wardrobe. And we mean truly handmade -
Vili’s been working their way through a series of Simon’s created entirely
without a sewing machine. (Note from Vili: I’ve since come around to the idea
of supplementing my hand sewing with a machine.)

The interview below has been edited for length, and any errors, oversights,
etc. are entirely the fault of the interviewer.

### How did you learn about FreeSewing?

I started sewing about two years ago, and I had an ebook on things you can do
without a pattern. I think it was called Radical Sewing. There were resources
at the end that mentioned FreeSewing. Open source, programmatic, parametric
patterns? Sold.

### How did you become a contributor?

I’m studying computer science, focusing on networking and system
administration. I was interested early in contributing something back to the
project, and then noticed a bug where some links to pattern option
documentation weren’t showing up. I submitted an issue, and mentioned I could
take a stab at it, and Joost being Joost came back with a super detailed list
of what was wrong and how to fix it. So I did.

### What has been your contributor work so far?

Mostly I’ve contributed minor quality of life improvements. If there’s a bug in
a pattern that’s causing a crash that’s easy to fix, I’ll take a look at it.
Also a lot of dead links. My favorite was when there were quite a few dead
links on the dev side of things, which went to a 404 page, and the “let us
know” link on the 404 page was also a dead link.

### How do you spend your time outside of FreeSewing?

Besides FreeSewing and sewing, I spend my time on a lot of computer stuff. I
host a lot of stuff for my own personal use.

### What are you currently working on? Finish any projects recently?

On the FreeSewing side of things, more of the same: fixing bugs, housekeeping,
and dead link extermination on the freesewing.org side of the site.

On the sewing side of things… Simons! I took a bit of a break, but am back at
it with something that is starting to resemble a shirt. I’m 26.5 hours into
making this current Simon. I don’t actually care how long it takes, but I want
to know, plus I’m curious if I’m getting faster. My first one took 60 hours, so
still plenty of time to come in under that.

### Did you make any updates after your last Simon? Do you have plans to sew any other patterns?

Well, first I retook all my measurements.Surprisingly enough, when your
measurements aren’t complete garbage, the patterns come out nicer. When I had
measurements that were more (or at all) accurate, all the things that I knew I
needed to fix about the pattern kind of fixed themselves in a lot of cases.

Beyond this Simon, I want to sew more Teagans, some Bruces, and I have four
more Simons to go (I have the fabric for them).

### What sewing/coding project are you most proud of?

I thought this would be an easy question because you just say “the last Simon I
made.” I think it still might be the last Simon I made, and when I get done
with this one, it’s gonna be this Simon. I think the pride in a project comes
from “we did something cool here,” but the enjoyment… if I learn something new
on a project, that’s more enjoyable.

### What in your life are you most proud of?

In general, I try to have an overall positive impact on the people around me. I
get a lot out of helping others, and supporting the people around me.

### What do you love the most about sewing?

I think what I love the most is the freedom to just decide for yourself what
exactly you’re going to be wearing. If I want a specific garment, I’m not
depending on someone else deciding it’s profitable, I can just make the garment
I want.

### What do you hate the most about sewing?

Tracing and cutting out pattern pieces – If I could just get my patterns precut
from the fabric I want, I think that’d be pretty good. I’m often working with
fabrics where the grainline is extremely obvious, and any imperfection is going
to show up immediately. I try to pattern match to an extent, the fronts and
backs match, and that’s about as far as I will go.

### What’s the hardest part of sewing to you?

Actually, either getting the pattern pieces traced and cut out of fabric, or
just getting the patterns to fit. For my second Simon, I didn’t do any fitting,
because I could compare the pattern pieces to the first one. I looked at the
differences, and felt pretty sure they’d fix the issues I was having. For the
first Simon, I went through five or six muslins, cut out the pieces, and did a
combination of running stitch and backstitch here and there to lock it in so it
didn’t take forever. But it still took a long time.

### What would be your advice for starting sewists?

A lot of it is going to come down to finding your motivation for sewing, and
picking a project that is going to motivate you. There’s a lot of beginner
friendly projects, but if you’re not interested in it, you’re just going to
stop doing it. Find out what you’re interested in, then figure out what skills
you need to do it.

My first two garments were hand-sewn Teagans – it was trial and error to figure
out what stitches actually worked, and it eventually worked great, but the
first one is a lot rougher, I think there are three or four types of stitches
on the first Teagan. Eventually something is gonna stick.

### Do you sew mostly for yourself, or for others like friends and family?

I haven’t sewn any garments for anyone else. I did make three burp cloths for
my brothers kids baby shower, but that’s the only thing.

### Are you a dog person or a cat person?

More of a dog person, but I will happily pet and cuddle both.

### If there was one thing you could take with you to an uninhabited island, what would it be? Why?

Is this a survival situation, or a get-away-from-civilization situation?

For a get-away-from-civilization situation, I think it’s going to be a sewing
project. That’s the one thing I do that’s properly unplugged from everything.
One of the things I love about sewing by hand, I can just grab the fabric and a
very minimal set of things and sew pretty much anywhere.

I recently came up with a super-minimal sewing kit with a friend, and I’m
pretty proud of it. A seam ripper, with the cover holding a pin, a needle, and
some thread wrapped around the shaft of the seam ripper. Weighs absolutely
nothing, takes up no space, has everything I need, you can take it anywhere.
And if you do need to cut something, a seam ripper is better than nothing.

### If there was one person you could take with you to an uninhabited island, who would it be? Why?

Any single person you bring with you, you’re gonna hate by the end of a couple
of weeks. But going alone, you’re also going to go insane. I’d gravitate most
to picking a volunteer out of my friends or family.

### Can we find you on social media?

I’m not on any social media, but you can check out one of my FreeSewing
showcases [here](https://freesewing.org/showcase/hand-sewn-test-of-florence)
and stay tuned for some Simon showcases.

## 🛟 Highlights from the Need Help channel on Discord

FreeSewing superstar Ben F. pulled together some recent highlights from the
`#need-help` channel on the [FreeSewing
Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/).

If you've run into trouble with a pattern, your answer might just be one of
these. If you've run into an issue, hop on over to the Discord for support and
discussion about ways to troubleshoot.

### Jaeger sleeve circumference

A sleeve that doesn't fit because sleeve circumference is smaller than biceps
circumference? For v3 FreeSewing designs, it was noted that the "Waist to
armpit", "HPS to waist", and "HPS to bust" measurements have become very
important. Inaccurate measurements can result in incorrect armseye and sleeve
circumferences.

### Please help! Messed up Hugo measurements

Too small sleevecap and armscye? Another issue with v3 FreeSewing sleeves due
to an inaccurate "Waist to armpit" measurement. Enabling the "Legacy armhole
depth" option to use v2 armholes (instead of using the "Waist to armpit"
measurement) is another possible remedy.

### My Bruce Pants are... Pants!

An initial attempt at making Bruce boxer briefs resulted in a too-short
garment? The fix was to correctly locate the location of the waist and retake
the "Waist to upper leg" measurement.

### Uneven shoulder measurements

How to deal with a medical issue causing the left and right shoulder
measurements to be significantly different? Ideas for creating garments to
accommodate this issue could include generating separate patterns for left and
right sides (using two different measurement sets), making garments with a
center separating zipper, and using a diagonal/asymmetrical hem.

### Sewing leather on a Singer

Using a jeans needle successfully pokes holes in the leather, but the thread
doesn't seem to be creating stitches? Tips to use a microtex or leather needle
and to make sure the leather fabric is feeding properly.

### Cross seam measurement:

How do you measure the cross seam measurement: nude, with tight-fitting
underwear, or with good-fitting pants on? Suggestions included measuring while
wearing the underwear intended to be worn with the garment, tying a ribbon
around the waist and using a second ribbon along the cross seam, and taking the
measurement while walking. Also, double-check your vertical measurements if
your pattern isn't fitting correctly in the crotch area.

## 🏋️ Six languages weigh more than one

Without wanting to alarm anyone, I recently suffered a bit of a crisis
feeling completely overwhelmed by all the work that is sitting in my inbox.
It's arguably not really new, and I don't think anyone is waiting for yet another
open source maintainer apologizing for being busy.

However, this was the first time this feeling crossed over from _phew, this is
a lot_ into _I can't do this any longer_ territory.

It's always darkest before dawn, and now that I've acknowledged that there's a
problem and came up with a plan to deal with it (which I'll get to in a second)
I'm feeling much better already, so no need to worry about me. However, I want
to be open and honest about where these changes are coming from and why I'm
making them.

What changes? Well, effective immediately, I will work towards making
FreeSewing simpler to maintain, and put more strict boundaries and what we do
and what we don't do.

I've already ported [FreeSewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/) to
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which makes it a lot easier to maintain.
There will be more under-the-hood changes like these that make our life easier,
without creating a material difference to our users.

Unfortunately, that alone won't cut it, so I also intent to drop support
for translation, and only maintain English from now onward.
This too will go unnoticed for the vast majority of our users, but obviously
not for all of them.

In May 2018, I wrote the following on the subject:

> _I’ve decided to add a new challenge to the mix: i18n._
>
> _In case you’re wondering, i18n is short for internationalization, aka making

Six and a half years later, I still believe that removing the language
barrier is important to reach as many people as possible. But I also think that
it's fair to say that if we are looking to do _less_ then this is the obvious
candidate of things to drop.

To put things in perspective: 87.9% of FreeSewing users have selected English
as their language of choice and thus will be unaffected by such a move. Of the
remaining users, those who prefer French form the largest contingent (7%)
followed by Spanish (3.2%), German (1.7%), Dutch (1.1%) and finally Ukrainian
(less then 0.1%). I don't have an easy way to extract similar data for our
patrons, but I can safely say that if you combine the US, Canada, UK, Ireland,
and Australia you have covered the vast majority of patrons too.

To those users who are affected, I am sorry that it has come to this. While
translation as such does not add too much overhead (although I handle most of
the Dutch translation so it's not nothing), the main culprit is the technical
complexity that comes from supporting multiple languages.
This is also why dropping one or more languages does not make a meaningful
difference.

I'm sharing these numbers because they provide context to frame these changes.
They are not a justification for these changes. All users matter, and all
patrons matter the world to me.
Just because one group is smaller than another does not mean we should throw
them under the bus. I hope that's something that needs no explaining. That
being said, when something's gotta give, I feel dropping translation is the
least impactful because in practice, I'm not convinced it matters all that much.

Today's browsers will translate pages on the fly, and I've more than once seen
people interact with the site in non-English, not because they opted for a
different language, but rather because their browser is in the habit of
translating all English content to whatever is their preferred language.
Furthermore, despite the great work of our many volunteer translators, a
significant amount of FreeSewing content remains machine-translated because
there's just _a lot_ of it. Does it really matter all that much whether it's
us providing the (machine) translation or the browser?
I don't believe it matters all that much.

To come full circle, I feel it's worth pointing out that nobody has ever asked
me to add translation to FreeSewing. I decided to add it because I felt that in
a perfect world, everyone could access FreeSewing in the language of their
choice. With the way machine learning (or _AI_ if you want) is going, that
reality is perhaps already upon us.

I apologize to those of you for which this is bad news, and if you are using
FreeSewing in your own projects, rest assured that this does not mean we are
removing translation support from our core library.

Long story short: I have come to realize I've bitten of more than I can chew,
and I am making adjustments to lighten the load.
If you have a better idea on how to do that, I'm all ears.
