One day there was an unexpected delivery on my doorstep. I wasn't really
certain what to make of it because I didn't recall ordering anything lately.
Suffice to say I was not at all prepared for the awesomeness inside because
when I opened the box I found this lovingly handcrafted real-life version of
Skully, FreeSewing's beloved logo and mascot.

This is the wonderful work for Wouter who also made [the
design](/designs/skully). So you can go and make a Skully for
yourself. You know you want one!
