![A young man with blue eyes and long blond hair stares at the camera. He is wearing a close-fitted blue vest over a black turtleneck. His hands are shoved into the pockets of a pair of pinstripe trousers.](https://imagedelivery.net/ouSuR9yY1bHt-fuAokSA5Q/showcase-a-dapper-man-in-dark-wool-1/public "The image caption/title goes here")
I'm really happy with how this turned out, although I was stretching the limitations of the software to accomplish it. His shoulder/chest/waist measurements meant that the first time I rendered, there was literally no armscye. I fixed it by artificially reducing the width of his shoulders and adding more ease in both the chest and waist. As you can see, it still fits extremely closely. I expect that this is because a percentage of body dimension for wearing ease works well in most cases, it fails when it is a percentage of a very small measurement. In any case, I did a couple mockups before I got a pattern that worked for us. I also reduced the hip flare. In this picture, he's wearing Charlie chinos that I made for him Christmas of 2023.
I may lengthen the next Wahid, based on where his trousers are sitting.
