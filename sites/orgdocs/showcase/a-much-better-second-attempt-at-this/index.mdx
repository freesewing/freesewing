Y'know the ship of Theseus? well, sometimes I feel like I use the customization options on here so much that it's like...is it even the same garment? Anyway turned out pretty cute, i promise the elastic isn't as messed up as it looks.

Also finally used this amazing fabric i've had in my stash for at least a year. For anyone who wasn't yet alive in the 90s, this is what they looked like. It was just muted purple and grey zebra stripes and embossed rattlesnakes for a whole decade.
