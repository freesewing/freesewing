At times I felt like I'd modified the pattern so much from its base form (this design is by far the most customizable of any FreeSewing project I've attempted) that I was approaching a Theseus situation (are they still Umbra if nothing that originally made them Umbra remains?) I also was attempting some pattern matching that I shouldn't have bothered with and ended up with some super bulky seams, but they're comfy as all get out and relatively flattering. PLUS I finally got to use this uber-90's No Fear-esque purple-and-grey-tiger-stripes-with-Cobras-on jersey that I've had for so long and thought I'd never use cause it's just too damn cool. And, as predicted, it totally works as undies.
