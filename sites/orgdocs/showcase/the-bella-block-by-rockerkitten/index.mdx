The Bella block is what brought RockerKitten to FreeSewing -- and we couldn't be more grateful that she found us! She has dialed in her preferences and measurements to find her ideal fit. This is one of her muslins.

RockerKitten graciously shares tips, encouragement, and advice with folks on [Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/). Come join the discussion over there if you're interested in trying FreeSewing's blocks!
