Higher values make a deeper armhole.","armholeDepthFactor.t":"Armhole depth factor (legacy)","armholeDepthFactor.d":"Controls the depth of the armhole. Higher values make a deeper armhole. This option only applies to the legacy (v2) way of calculating the armhole depth.","backNeckCutout.t":"Back neck cutout","backNeckCutout.d":"How deep the neck is cut out at the back","bicepsEase.t":"Biceps ease","bicepsEase.d":"The amount of ease at your upper arm. Note that while we try to respect this, fitting the sleeve to the armhole takes precedence over respecting the exact amount of ease.","collarEase.t":"Collar ease","collarEase.d":"The amount of ease around your neck","chestEase.t":"Chest ease","chestEase.d":"The amount of ease at your chest.","cuffEase.t":"Cuff ease","cuffEase.d":"The amount of ease at your wrist.","draftForHighBust.t":"Draft for high bust","draftForHighBust.d":"Draft the pattern using the high bust measurement if it is available, instead of using the chest measurement. This can result in a more fitted garment for people with breasts. (Please note that no additional adjustments or shaping is performed. Further manual adjustments may be needed for those with a larger difference between high bust and chest measurements.)","draftForHighBustYes.t":"Draft using the high bust measurement","draftForHighBustYes.d":"Drafts a pattern using the high bust measurement instead of the chest measurement. Suggested for most people with breasts.","draftForHighBustNo.t":"Draft using the chest measurement","draftForHighBustNo.d":"Drafts a pattern using the chest measurement. Suggested for most people without breasts.","frontArmholeDeeper.t":"Front armhole extra cutout","frontArmholeDeeper.d":"How much do you want the front armhole to be cut out deeper than the back.","legacyArmholeDepth.t":"Legacy armhole depth","legacyArmholeDepth.d":"Enable this option to use the legacy way to calculate the armhole depth (using biceps circumference) rather than the v3 way (using the waist to armpit measurement)","legacyArmholeDepthNo.t":"Calculate armhole depth the v3 way","legacyArmholeDepthNo.d":"Uses the waist to armpit measurement to locate the bottom of the armhole","legacyArmholeDepthYes.t":"Calculate armhole depth the legacy (v2) way","legacyArmholeDepthYes.d":"Uses the biceps measurement to locate the bottom of the armhole","lengthBonus.t":"Length bonus","lengthBonus.d":"The amount to lengthen the garment.

Decreasing it shifts it backwards.","s3Armhole.t":"Shoulder seam shift: armhole side","s3Armhole.d":"Increase this option to shift the shoulder seam forward on the armhole side. Decreasing it shifts it backwards.","shoulderEase.t":"Shoulder ease","shoulderEase.d":"The amount of ease at your shoulder. This increases the shoulder to shoulder distance to accommodate additional layers or thickness.","shoulderSlopeReduction.t":"Shoulder slope reduction","shoulderSlopeReduction.d":"The amount by which the shoulder slope is reduced to allow for shoulder padding.","sleeveLengthBonus.t":"Sleeve length bonus","sleeveLengthBonus.d":"The amount to lengthen the sleeve.
